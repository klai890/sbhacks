Financial Aid changed for Winter Quarter
Hi my UCSB scholarship just shot up by a lot which is great but im scared it's some type of mistake and I will end up having to pay it back if I do spend it. Did anyone else see an increase or decrease in their financial aid this quarter?

"They might not still be open, but there's an office on the 3rd floor of ILP that has some staff/students that provide technical support for the building.  They might be able to get you in.

Otherwise the custodial staff will probably turn it in to the lost and found over the weekend."
Drivers license
"I am an international student, I don‚Äôt have a drivers license. I need to get it but I don‚Äôt have a car to take the test with. I haven‚Äôt taken the written test yet either but I know I‚Äôll pass it because I took it to get my motorcycle permit. What to do?

Anyone willing to lend their car for an hour of practice and the test maybe? I‚Äôd be willing to pay."
"Local driving lesson companies have an option that they will lend you their car to use for the test.  


This one comes to mind although the package is the most expensive. Maybe reach out to them to see if its possible to just rent the car.   
https://coastlineacademy.com/pricing"
Afaik some coach does this kind of stuff. They charge you for like 110 bucks each time. The thing is you may not pass the test in the first try with one hour of practice. So be prepared for that
I probably could I just passed the written test online but apparently I have wait until Tuesday to get my permit
Many of my friends (including myself) failed the first road test even though we have some driving experience in our home country. There are many details in the road test I would say find a coach or someone who have taken the test in Goleta might be a good option.

I think a potential grenade near the train tracks solidly qualifies as a potential emergency. Straight up call 911
"I did, apparently somebody before me called about it"
That's really not smth to joke about
"I mean, if you commute by train it's definitely unsafe."
I mean to be fair the kind of person to leave a real grenade next to some train tracks doesn‚Äôt seem to be the kind of person who would obey California‚Äôs ban on grenades

Econ/econ & accounting students forum
"Hi All, 
My friend and I recently started a forum for economics students to be able to communicate with one another and ask questions regarding certain subjects, classes and even help with resume building and finding jobs. There is also a resource section that has direct links to everything from beneficial economic information from strong sources, important dates, and even help with meal planning. As a UCSB economics students myself, I had a hard time finding any sort of online help and hope as a community we can use one another to further our learning and understanding of the many topics we cover in Econ. Please feel free to send an email giving any advice on how we can further improve the site. If you are not an Econ student and decide to check it out and like it, please also let me know I can try to replicate it for a different major. Hope you all find it helpful!

UCSB Alumni
Have any UCSB alumni found any benefits from the alum networking events or various financial seminars? Anyone have experience with this?
The only alumni things I've received is UCSB asking for donations...I get a phone call about once every 6 months directly asking for contributions.
I‚Äôve been receiving donation request letters annually since I graduated in 1981. They are relentless despite having never once given anything.
I actually got my current job through an alumni networking zoom session. Never know who you‚Äôre going to meet. üòä
"Yeah I met a few at some events while I worked in Washington DC, always worth checking out."
n=1 but I matched with one through an alumni mentorship program and they invited me to their workplace then they ghosted
I got a phone call 1 month after I graduated trying to get me to donate $23/month. Absolutely ridiculous.
if you ask them (kindly) to take you off the list they will. otherwise if you just turn them down for donations it'll cycle you back into the roster in a few months time.
True same here
"Out of curiosity, was that specifically a UC(SB?) alumni meet up, or you just happened to meet UCSB alumni while at some event?"
"A month after I graduated, around 80% of my income as a measly UCSB lab tech went towards rent - not including food, utilities, and the other essentials. I'm not quite sure what they are expecting - maybe start with the 5/10yr+ alumni?"
Really? I‚Äôve received one call as class of ‚Äò23 and it was for a one time $20.23 donation for the class gift
It was an event hosted by all the UC alumni associations I believe. Not SB specifically.
You‚Äôre right! I‚Äôm also class of 2023 and they called me trying to get me to pay that. Still a crazy price monthly
I did it and it was a one time only donation and they mailed me a paper thank you letter or something
"They did have a higher one time gift donation which was $450 or so, but I denied it and they said that they throw that out there because a few rich people say yes and then said that $20.23 was the other option"
All day visitor lots
Does anyone know what other lots allow all day visitors besides Sierra Madre? The lot gets full really quick but we need to park somewhere that expires at 10am and is available any day of the week.

AS President Recall
We have been trying to get AS to initiate the recall procedure for the past month but they continue to make up excuses and stalling. If any of you would be willing to email elections@as.ucsb.edu and urge them to follow through with the recall procedure it would be greatly appreciated!!!
"AS is nothing more than a glorified internship program for students who want to enter politics. You all give them way too much credit and care about what they do, as if any AS President ever did anything meaningful. Your time and energy are better prioritized elsewhere. Trust me.

Honestly now that I think about it, nothing screams privilege more than being able to care this much about AS. These are peak first world problemsüòÇ"
Curious what kind of misconduct you think the President engaged in?  As a rule I don't think it's good to remove elected officials outside of a normal election cycle just because you disagree with them.
"Recalls are un-democratic, unless used to remove someone actively engaging in illegal or dangerous behavior. You not liking a decision they made isn't a reason to remove someone duly elected to office."
"Yall need to chill. I get it, I was like you too when I was an undergrad. But it‚Äôll blow over when the next big controversy hits. Y‚Äôall gotta stop using buzz words like fascism or suppressing rights so carelessly. It trivializes their meaning when actual fascism and rights suppression still exist in the world. Look no further than Russia. Surely your AS president isn‚Äôt sending secret police after you are they? Just unplug from social media occasionally and enjoy your time at SB"
"If they are making excuses, that is illegal. Something fishy is going on."
She got ucsb to be the first UC school to claim pro-palestine statements are anti-semantic. That is mad embarrassing a student here.
"They deal with large sums of money. There‚Äôs a lot at stake if you think about it and there‚Äôs really no independent oversight that exists. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs related to privilege, but maybe your lack of interest in political activism."
"Because the President suppressed political views other than her own, not representing the students."
She actively blocks students and deletes comments on student run accounts. On her personal media she also continues to shame the ucsb student population.
"only just over 400 students voted her in, most of the school doesn‚Äôt pay attention to AS. the reason ppl care is because she is deleting comments and blocking students on 3 different AS school account, not just her personal, which is her right. she has also intentionally excluded muslim and arab students from taking part in senate discussions that involve their rights. not to mention that she is very controlling and won‚Äôt even listen to other students in AS. it is not undemocratic to recall someone who is failing in their role. also obviously there is disagreement on a lot of issues but considering that she is pushing for decisions that the majority of the student population does not agree with shows that she is not even attempting to represent our student population."
Ironic that you would say a recall isn‚Äôt democratic. That‚Äôs a really shocking comment to be honest.
luckily she‚Äôs censoring the population she represents which is upholding fascist ideals! incredibly dangerous imo she also makes students of color feel unsafe as seen in recent comments on the aspresident account
"I think it‚Äôs wrong to compare comments made here to Russia. That‚Äôs not the point. What‚Äôs occurring and what has occurred for so long is an institution that is getting closer to being only a political machine. By definition of fascism, the current AS cannot be said to not be such based on the facts in this matter. Just because a loaded term used doesn‚Äôt mean that we can dismiss it bc the term applies much more broadly."
I happen to actually read the resolution passed by AS Senate last quarter. Where did it say pro-palestine statements are antisemitic?
"
It‚Äôs semitic*

And care to explain how this claim by a school in California affects the reality across the world where real people are dying?

If even the UN can't enforce any of their resolutions, do you really think the role-playing senators at AS can? üòÇ

Also that resolution was authored by other senators, not even the AS President lol"
"They get $15 million to allocate from UCSB's $1.3 billion annual budget, which amounts to just 1%. While it may appear like a lot, this is nothing but play money for these institutions. Again, a glorified internship program. Tell me more about your first world problems in sunny Santa Barbara"
How'd she do that exactly?
Sounds like you just disagree with her and don't like how she's exercising her First Amendment rights.  That's not a reason to recall someone.
"Her decisions don't have to be popular. They don't have to align with what a majority of students want. That's what elections are for. If she was justly elected and isn't breaking any laws or university guidelines, you are stuck with her. Trying to force a recall with a fraction of the support she was elected with is undemocratic."
"How is she ""censoring the population""? You are literally posting your opinions on a forum right now."
"Man no shit it doesn‚Äôt have a huge impact, but considering she is choosing to use a ‚Äòglorified internship‚Äô to be so extremely vocal about politics that the student population doesn‚Äôt support means she shouldn‚Äôt be in the glorified internship. And considering how the meeting I just brought up didn‚Äôt include the ucsb msa while making statements about islamophobia on campus, her actions are having a negative impact on the student population. Nobody thinks recalling her will stop the war or do anything on a wide scale. That doesn‚Äôt mean she shouldn‚Äôt face repercussions for failing to represent the student population and pushing her personal political beliefs???"
It doesn‚Äôt matter. You obviously don‚Äôt understand how percentages work.
"Technically, no reason is needed for a recall. It‚Äôs what the voters want. If you disagree that‚Äôs understandable but maybe just wait to cast ur vote when the recall happens then!"
"Her job is to represent the student population. Silencing the student population is the exact opposite and is the most blatant form of misconduct. She is allowed to express personal beliefs on her own account and block people, but that does not apply to AS student accounts, which she has been using to silence students who don‚Äôt agree with her."
her job as president is quite literally to represent the students of ucsb if she‚Äôs being a fascist and suppressing student voices and not doing her job why the fuck would she have a reason to stay in her position üò≠ also as someone in AS she barely does anything other than post political stuff on her story all day why do we have someone that‚Äôs so unfocused on their job?
"No, but other students' first Amendment rights are being taken away. She doesn't have to believe in them, but even if she tried to half-address it it would be better than nothing. Someone told me she labeled the Muslim community here as a terrorist organization, which is falsely accusing them of causing harm on campus and people will start hating on them, which is not promoting the safety and inclusivity of UCSB. We're supposed to support each other here, and even if AS President doesn't agree, she can at least do something like gove resources for help."
"if the recall goes through, then that's democracy at work. a recall isn't just 10 people calling for it, it would take a whole vote"
there are more students who want her recalled than there are students that voted her in. she also is literally breaking rules and guidelines as we stated above.
"Terrible you would think this. You obviously are extremely opposed in this matter, for whatever reason‚Ä¶"
"by deleting comments when they don‚Äôt align with her beliefs, blocking people, and only responding to the people who agree with her i feel like that‚Äôs wrong she‚Äôs supposed to represent all of her students not just a select population and she‚Äôs picking and choosing who she wants to represent / respond to"
Absolutely. Couldn‚Äôt be said better.
"Also it makes an impact on campus and the safety of Arab, Muslim, and pro-Palestinian students. We have had students' cars being damaged, verbally harassed, and in the case of a Black student, racially abused at their doorstep. Yes, Her words and actions don't impact the safety of Palestinians in Gaza, but it does impact the safety of already marginalized and traumatized students on this campus."
"Yea I guess my B.S in Stats & Data Science was a scam lmao.

Just admit that you‚Äôre privileged enough to be able to care this much about something as meaningless AS"
How is anything you describe a violation of the First Amendment?
"It's impossible for her to ""represent all of her students"" when there is such a divide between members of the student body. She must make decisions to her best judgement, and it's inevitable that some - like you - will disagree and feel disenfranchised. This doesn't make her a criminal or an imminent threat to the safety of anyone. 

Vote for the candidate you like, hope they win, but don't attempt to unjustly remove them if they don't."
"She's not letting other people have their freedom of speech and beliefs/religion, people claim that AS is democratic but it's nowhere near it."
"it‚Äôs also possible for her to just not delete comments simply because they don‚Äôt align with her personal beliefs that‚Äôs all i‚Äôm saying like why is she doing that in the first place this has been an issue for years but no as president in the past has ever gone so far as to delete student comments i just want a president who is willing to see both sides and not get rid of the people on one end can‚Äôt you agree that‚Äôs wrong

i would‚Äôve been fine with her as president if she simply never removed comments and blocked people just for disagreeing with her it‚Äôs dictator-like"
You haven't explained how your free speech rights have been abridged.
On what platform are comments being deleted? And how do you know she is deleting comments she doesn't agree with?
"You're just gonna keep asking me to explain it and continuously reject my explanation so this is not gonna end. Even if I did explain it well it doesn't change the fact that people are mad, and that their voices weren't heard."
"instagram, there would be comments under her posts talking about palestine and then they would be gone shortly thereafter but the commenters did not remove them by themselves ( i‚Äôve had people reach out to me or i‚Äôve asked them after seeing the comments disappear )"
Being made to feel not included or having someone in a position of quasi political authority disagree with you is NOT a First Amendment violation.
"I'm not sure an inability to post on Instagram actually qualifies as fascism (people who have lived under genuine fascist regimes could weigh in on this), but you could always start your own Instagram account and post as much as you like."
"This is on her personal instagram, not the ucsb as pres insta. She can do what she wants with her personal account"
Your really invested in her office. What stake do you have?
i‚Äôm just saying she‚Äôs upholding the ideals in her oppression of opposition and bringing up everyone who agrees with her not that this is fascism this is nowhere near mussolini it‚Äôs the most you can do without getting backlash in this day and age
Absolutely but she can also face a recall.

"This might be a stupid question, but on GOLD it says the last day to drop a lower division WRIT course is this Friday, which is tomorrow. Just wondering if Linguistic 70 count as a WRIT course or only the course that starts with WRIT (something) count? Thanks"
"It means the small 25 person area A/elwr writing classes (writ 1, writ 2, etc.) not courses that are GEs and provide special subject writing."

EEMB 129 for pre med?
"I‚Äôm a fourth year and need to take genetics for pre med and EEMB 129 (intro to genetics) is available and MCDB 101A isn‚Äôt. Do any pre meds know if EEMB 129 is fine for med school? I don‚Äôt really care if one class will have me better prepared, just if it‚Äôs acceptable"
Took it last year and we used the same textbook as the MCDB class. It‚Äôs best to talk to an advisor about this though.
I‚Äôm taking it as a pre med and haven‚Äôt heard anyone say it wouldn‚Äôt work
Has blenders always been like this?
Got a large from blenders this afternoon and noticed the bottom of the actual cup had a large gap to the edge of the outer cup. Looked like it was two cups stuck together so i peeled off the side of the cup and found a smaller cup inside with glue? lines around it designed to stick the outer layer to the inner cup
Ya it's to insulate it
"So glad to see this!

They used to be styrofoam.

This surely offers decent insulation at lesser environmental cost."
"blenders cups have changed a couple times so I wouldn't be surprised if they changed again- source, I used to work there"
It's what the switched to when they got rid of styrofoam. My local store used to have a little sign talking about it.
I had completely forgotten about their styrofoam era!
Kalju Kahn's (Biochemistry Prof.) office hours/contact?
"Hi all, 

I'm an UCSB alumni that graduated in 2020. Currently applying to some post-bachelor's program and I've been trying to reach out to Kahn for an evaluation. I've been exhausted most of my resources: I could not get him to reply to my emails (might have been filtered to spam due to non .edu address), the department phone line is useless since they don't pick up the phone nor checking their voicemails. I've reached out to the phone number posted on his webpage per UCSB directory, and again no luck. If someone that is currently in his biochem lab series or classes (if he still teaches them) let me know his office hours for this quarter, it'll be greatly appreciated. 

&#x200B;

I know that there is an office hours posted on his webpage as well but I think it is outdated and has not been updated. Thank you in advance! "
kahn is currently not teaching any courses this quarter (he taught some upper div biochem electives last quarter) bc from what i've overheard from my other peers are that he's not allowed to teach the biochem lab series or classes anymore (and i can surely see why lol). his office hours on the chem website are definitely outdated. best of luck to you for reaching out to him though
thank you for letting me know. do you know if Reich still teaches?
"Thank goodness, they finally let the goddamn guy go."
"reich still teaches i believe, you‚Äôll definitely have higher chances of reaching reich over kahn."
do you by chance know his office hours for this quarter? thanks a bunch for your response
i unfortunately do not.
Power Outage?
"Is anyone else experiencing a power outage? Can anyone on campus confirm that it still has power?

My whole unit has no electricity atm

EDIT: I'm on Camino Del Sur

EDIT 2: Power back for my unit as of 4:50pm"
"No power on Abrego either. SoCal Edison is showing 3500 customers w/o power rn, must be almost IV-wide"
No power on Sabado
power works on campus
No power on DP
"Yeah, I saw it says maybe repaired by 5:30 but it didn't specify the areas affected.

Also I didn't get a notification or anything about it lol classic SCE"
"Appreciate you btw, was debating about going to the lib to charge my devices lol"
"Most likely unplanned, maybe the wind.
The website shows it as ‚Äúrepair outage‚Äù not ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù, I don‚Äôt think they would ever shut off power to so many people intentionally. (Unless it‚Äôs PSPS during peak fire season‚Äîbut we‚Äôve never had one here)"
yeah no problem!
"Ya, but it also says our area is a high risk area and so in the event of a fire they would turn off our electricity.

Obviously not what's happening here, but before I had a better idea that's what I had assumed might've been going on: they finally sent a formal email at least!"
Okay. 4:50pm and it just came back for me! Anyone else? Edit: just saw ur edit. Yay!
Would it look bad to email UCSB to change intended major after deadline?
"The deadline to change your chosen major was December 31st for first-time freshman, but I thought that it was January 31st like some other UC's. My primary major is CS and my alternative is Computer Engineering, but I heard that it's really hard to get into UCSB for these majors, so maybe changing my alternative to like EE would be better. Would it be dumb to email UCSB admissions and ask if I could still change it since I really want to attend?"
"Here‚Äôs the thing: Generally speaking if you aren‚Äôt considered for the first major in College of Engineering you won‚Äôt be approved for the second and adjusting it from CE to EE (which are housed in the same department together) won‚Äôt do much. 

Students who select two COE majors but aren‚Äôt considered for that college could possibly be offered a spot in L&S as undeclared if nothing from l&s is selected. Then you can always ask to declare within an l&s major like stats or math before school starts if you decide to go to ucsb for a non-engineering major."
Do what your heart tells you big dog
"You would definitely end up in UCSB secret files on students who don't care about deadlines, and then it will be mentioned on your diploma.

Go ahead dude. It won't hurt to just ask!"
"> Would it look bad

Why do you care what some staff person thinks?"
Anyone Selling Thermal Leggings and Undershirts?
"howdy fellow lagooners, i am wondering if anyone is selling or giving away warm undergarments: thermal leggings and underwear type clothing. im so dang cold all the time but really don‚Äôt want to buy anything new from target/amazon rn and can‚Äôt afford to shop REI or any higher end sustainable brands. so if anyone out there has any extra warm undergarments plz help a snowman out. im typically a size small/medium. every night i have to rub my feet together like a cricket before bed and im TIRED of it."
"one option might be the thrift stores nearby.

otherwise, do you have an amazon wishlist? send over a link and ill send a pair over, assuming its reasonable (no gucci pls). i think the wishlist link makes it so i can essentially pay for it without having to get your address and stuff, if you care about that sort of thing. my first quarter at ucsb was coming from somewhere much warmer, and i had only brought shorts, so i definitely remember the struggle."
You can check out Ross or invest in a space heater from fb marketplace
Tell ur parents ur cold dawg I'm sure they'd be happy to order some for you online
check the ucsb free & for sale facebook page if you're not already in it! lots of people post stuff everyday & at decent prices :-)
"you‚Äôre so sweet üíïüíï ill definitely check thrift stores, but don‚Äôt worry about purchasing any for little old me. i‚Äôm mostly being stubborn about wanting to shop used/pre-owned for all my clothing in 2024 and just wanted to see if there was anyone in the ucsb community who was selling before checking ebay or depop or whatnot. what i‚Äôve learned from this experience is that ucsb is full of a bunch of sweetie pies!!! thank you for the offer and i hope you have a lovely day and find a wad of $20 bills on the ground"
Flu test at SHS?
"So I was wondering if SHS could provide any treatment (like medicine) for a flu or can they do anything like a flu test to see if it‚Äôs a flu or just a ‚Äònormal‚Äô high fever. I doubt I caught a flu because I was sneezing so hard that I couldn‚Äôt open my eyes and my whole body feels dizzy. My fever went to 39.1 C last night and was reduced to 37.5 C this morning after I took two times of Tylenol but I‚Äôm afraid it would go up again :/ 

I do have an appointment this morning but I just want to know if I may still need to visit an off-campus ER."
is feldwinn really that bad of a chem professor??
"starting to accept the fact that i'm not getting off the waitlist for either of josephs lectures so i'm gonna switch lol.

everything i see about her is just so bad tho and i'm wondering if her class is really that difficult to get through??? for chem 1b specifically. i did good in chem 1a but that was with an entirely different teaching style so idk"
"A lot of websites/ratings for professors will come from people with strong opinions, so keep that in mind when looking around. She didn't stand out to me notably as a good or bad lecturer to me, compared to some other professors at UCSB, but I also had to ""retake"" chem since the UC's do that weird thing where you still have to take the chem series despite passing AP chem, so most of it was just review. I can imagine that someone learning it for the first time around could have a different experience.

On the flipside, there are at least a handful of professors that wrote the textbook, and spend the lecture, well, lecturing from the textbook word for word....You'll probably encounter a few in a year or so assuming you need to take ochem.

Personally, I had a lot of respect for her given that she co-founded SciTrek, which really helps younger students (grades 2-8?) get excited about science. I would imagine that the professor that started that is also equally capable of teaching college-level students, but perhaps not. In a similar vein, perhaps intro chem isn't something that she's as invested in as SciTrek, who knows. YMMV - if you need help with material, reach out to CLAS and/or her/TAs office hours."
Idk if she‚Äôs that bad or if the other professors for gen chem are just significantly better. Sitting through 1 of feldwinn‚Äôs lectures made me want to gauge my eyes out. Joseph and Price are much better at lecturing but also make harder tests than feldwinn.

Making friends
"How do yall make friends? I spent my first quarter ever mainly alone and it honestly sucks, I tried making friends during my classes but no one ever stuck or seemed interested so I just left them alone.

where to change grading option on GOLD
I can't find where to change the grading option for a GE Im taking on GOLD. Is it under the modify button (which is unclickable for all my classes) or do I find it somewhere else?
"I asked today, the response was that that it‚Äôs an issue with gold and they are working to get it fixed!"
"Yes it would be under modify, but I don‚Äôt know why your access to that feature would be blocked unless you have a standard hold on your registration. You can check your registration info page to see if that‚Äôs the case."
Math 4a help
"I just had my first-ever college math lecture (I took calc in HS and didn't take math fall Q), and it was pretty shitty. I don't see myself learning anything from the lecture. How realistically can I learn this class by going to CLAS tutorial groups 2x a week and watching MIT 18.06 lectures? 

I feel like I can't watch a professor do 2 sample problems in shitty handwriting to learn a topic; I need to do hella practice problems and learn from what I do wrong. LMK some strategies for self-studying and learning from shitty lectures (because I know this isn't gonna be the only time I struggle to learn from a lecture). "
"You can definitely learn everything in 4A by just going to CLAS. That‚Äôs what I did. In fact the few people in my section that understood what‚Äôs going on all attended CLAS. I still recommend going to the lecture, just to get exposed to the material. The CLAS instructor will then explain it very clearly."
"Ur best bet is watching YouTube videos on the given topics in class, I recommend 3blue1brown to understand linear algebra conceptually. Pair that with CLAS and practice problems and you‚Äôll be more than okay"
"Check DMs, I sent you my annotated notes"
Math lectures are mostly useless. Especially lower divs. But each experience is different‚Ä¶
"I‚Äôve been just watching YouTube lectures and going to CLAS, which has been really helpful.

Why TF are we paying to use a knockoff canvas
Why are professors allowed to force students to buy a certain subscription by making the homework ONLy available on that website!!! There‚Äôs no way they don‚Äôt get any sort of commission
What website do you have to buy a separate subscription to?
What happened to GauchoSpace?
its all part of the business
A likely reason would be the professor didn't create the homework. The website hired people to do that. And the Prof is just avoiding come up with homework themselves

College of Creative Studies vs College of Letters and Sciences??
"I submitted my UCSB application recently as a math major and a few weeks later, got this email...

""I'm writing on behalf of the mathematics faculty at UC Santa Barbara's College of Creative Studies (CCS). We've noticed that you are a promising applicant to UCSB who has indicated a desire to major in mathematics in the College of Letters and Science. I am writing to invite you to consider submitting a second application to instead major in mathematics through CCS.We are looking for people who want to immerse themselves in mathematics with a small group of other motivated and curious students in a noncompetitive and supportive environment. If you enjoy the \`\`why it works'' aspect of math, like talking about math with friends, or want a deep problem solving background for your future career, then you may be a good candidate for our program.""

I'm slightly confused about the differences between these two... I mean, math is math, right? Ultimately, if I switched to CCS, would it possibly affect any chances of admittance to UCSB?"
You have much more freedom to choose classes as a CCS math major. Basically CCS is the enhanced version of normal math major. You can choose any math classes you want and you have the earliest pass time. At least give it a try
"That's pretty cool. If they are inviting you, definitely try to apply. You can always apply again - I think its every quarter but I don't remember for sure. I got in during my second year."
"The smartest guy I ever knew did a physics major through CCS. This was almost 10 years ago, but if I remember correctly, he got priority registration every quarter, and essentially got to build his major however he wanted instead of following the normal curriculum. I wish I had really known about the CCS program back then."
"I believe that your admission chances would stay the same. If CCS doesn‚Äôt admit you, then you‚Äôll go into L&S.

I‚Äôd recccomend looking at the ccs site 

Link- https://ccs.ucsb.edu/majors/mathematics"
"I liked being the CCS. If you know absolutely what you want, CCS can release you from some other requirements."
"I was a CCS Computing major and I would highly recommend it over L&S. Some benefits include: 
- Early pass times
- Can drop classes until week 10 (the week before the final), vs week 2-3 normally
- Small classes / seminars - we had 16 people in our year for computing, so in addition to the giant main classes, we also had ‚Äòcozy‚Äô ccs courses in special topics
- Freedom on GEs, from what I remember, the main criteria for GEs was a certain number of classes that were ‚Äúcompletely unrelated to computers‚Äù"
Feel free to ask questions or set up a zoom meeting with the weirdo who sent that. He‚Äôd be happy to explain the differences!
"In ccs math right now. If you got this email, it's very likely you'll get in regardless of what college you apply. Apply to CCS asap!
You can start off with higher level classes, less gen eds, more freedom to choose classes, more priority, no unit cap per quarter (letters and science has 20 units at most and it's kinda horrible), access to a bunch of other perks. There is no reason not to apply to CCS and specifically for math, CCS is better than even Berkeley in a lot of ways. Good luck!
Also highly recommend checking out the CCS website for more info. They describe it as a grad school for undergrads, which happens to be pretty accurate for CCS math people."
"Oh and as some of the other comments mentioned, CCS gives you access to special topics classes, has a lower emphasis on grades (basically guarantees a 4.0 while treating every subject with great rigor), and allows you to drop classes very late."
ECON 107A emails??

I can't get into anything except my email because it requires 2 factor authentication that I do not have because MY PHONE IS IN THE OCEAN. I tried to go to the IT support website that DUO gave me, but then it asked me for 2 factor authentication.

But I can't get into my student health account. 

Does anyone know how I can fix this? Can I walk to student health and manually cancel my appointment? Is there a tech support desk that can help me set up DUO on my laptop or something? Thanks. "
You need to reach out to IT and have them log you in for the day -- you can do that at a housing front desk. The same thing happened to me before.

How strict is UCSB on 90 (quarter) transfer credits?
"Long story short, I‚Äôll only have 81 (quarter units) by the end of Spring Term. I have a 3.9 GPA, elected Officer of Recruitment for a student organization, volunteer, have taken a few honors courses, and won a couple of awards.

I explained my situation as a non traditional, independent, student who also has to work to survive in my UC application. Will I automatically be denied? 

Edit: I offered to take summer classes to get me to 90 before attending. "
"Direct from the website: 

>Attaining eligibility means meeting the minimum requirements to be admitted to UC Santa Barbara. UCSB only accepts transfer students at the junior level (between 60-89 semester units or 90-134 quarter units)

So the minimum unit requirement is 90 quarter units.  A requirement is a REQUIREMENT.  

You can contact UCSB admissions and inquire but I would say not meeting the minimum eligibility requirements gives you close to zero chance.  I have never heard of a transfer applicant being admitted by exception (meaning not meeting the minimum requirements) but I guess it is worth a try."
"Try taking classes in the summer to meet the 90 units. I was supposed to get to 90 units last semester and had to drop a class, and they resended my admission. However, they basically implied I could take the class over Summer and still attend in the Fall. The UC is a business and they are pretty strict about their guidelines, and if they make an exception for you that means they have to make one for everyone. However, it may be worth it to reach out to a UC representative and discuss your situation."
Could you get the minimum 90 units by taking summer classes? Perhaps look into that
"You could be half a unit off the 90 and they still won‚Äôt take you. The only way they‚Äôll take you is if you are taking summer classes that will get you to the 90 units by the time you start at ucsb. However, if you do not meet the 90 unit requirement by the end of the summer term, your offer will be rescinded."
I would recommend contacting the office of admissions directly and seeing what your options are! pretty much all transfers are able to appeal their admissions decision since the requirements are so straightforward so they might be able to work with you
Do you have any AP exams scores of 4 or 5 (maybe 3 idk)? I was under 90 credits but I had two AP classes that took me over the edge.
Fair. Just wanted to see if anyone had been in my situation before.
"Worddd. I offered to take summer classes, so hopefully that works."
"Yeah, I offered to take summer classes if it helps with my admission!"
For sure. I offered to take summer classes if it helped with my admission.
Thanks!
Nah I don‚Äôt. ü´†

"Hello,

I hope you are doing well. From my experience taking UC Online classes, they have (for the most part) counted toward the General Subject Area Requirements, as an equivalent course, or as unit credit. If you are looking at a specific course to take via UC Online, I would speak to the College of Letters & Science (or your specific division) to see if that course would count towards credits in a Special Subject Area (ex. Writing). It can possibly count, but it depends on the division handling the transcript. I hope this information helps. Have a great Winter Quarter!"

"There‚Äôs a track on campus you can use. There are also tons of trails around campus and Isla Vista. I recommend checking out the North Campus Open Space. Tons of running and walking trails there. Take Venoco road from the family housing near Sierra Madre and you can go all the way to the bluffs, great running trails over there with awesome views of the ocean. 

There are so many paths that go everywhere! I encourage you to just get outside and start running somewhere! Explore around and enjoy the beautiful area you‚Äôre in."

DO NOT get a tattoo from Precious Slut!
"DO NOT get a tattoo from Precious Slut! I got one from their Friday the 13th flash day last December and it was horrible. The ""artist"" was sloppy and rushed, and I ended up with a really shitty tattoo. It looked fine at first but the ""artist"" didn't insert the ink at the right depth and after healing the tattoo looks so faded and uneven. They didn't follow proper sanitation procedures (I don't think they wrapped the machine at all) and they just used saran wrap and masking tape to wrap the tattoo.

Out of my 20 or so tattoos, that one from Precious Slut is by far the worst. Seriously, don't go there. "
No shit
"Respectfully, the idea of permanently modifying your body at a place called ‚ÄúPrecious Slut‚Äù may be the dumbest thing possible."
"don‚Äôt get any piercings there either! they do not use body safe jewelry and all 3 of the piercings I got there had to be removed. 

I recommend golden eagle for tattoos & above & beyond body arts (upstairs from golden eagle) for piercings (who can also be found on safepiercing.org)"
"I came so close to going there so many times, but I heard similar horror stories and thankfully heeded the warning. hope your tattoo is fixable!"
"there‚Äôs a new tattoo studio opening in IV, it‚Äôs run by a local student and she‚Äôs amazing! i‚Äôve gotten a couple done by her, and i will definitely be getting more, her insta is @cilegna"
"Damn everyone‚Äôs shitting on OP, but I genuinely would have assumed somewhere that has been in business in IV for so long must have been at least passable?"
"I got a few tattoos there a few years ago by a specific artist but he left- his work was actually pretty good. But yeah, wouldn‚Äôt recommend getting stuff there either. Pre Covid they had some pretty good artists but it‚Äôs only gone downhill"
"I got a huge side piece from them in 2009 and it was fire. The artist did a great job. Idk if the one I got a tattoo from is still there; but the real advice (and takeaway) is to know your artist and research before you get a tattoo, no matter where you go"
Dude come on man. That‚Äôs like common sense lmao
"With 100% confidence, I‚Äôm never going there for a tattoo."
"I also learned the hard way :( 

They pierced one of my nipples when I was COMPLETELY blackout drunk in 2014. Woke up and had no idea why I was in pain. They messed it up so badly too. Took it out in 2017 for good and still have issues. 

They‚Äôll do anything you ask‚Ä¶but not well ü´£"
If only there were some kind of clue that might have given you pause before signing up to have your body forever damaged ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
Which artist?
Drive downtown to Golden Eagle if you want a tattoo. Precious Slut is notoriously bad at tattoos and piercings.
Kind of your fault you got a flash tattoo on Friday the 13th what kind of quality would you expect
"you went to an artist you didn't know at a place called ""precious slut"" on a flash day sale and got a bad tattoo? Is it typical of you to make poor decisions and then blame others?"
"Bro went to ""precious slut"" and expected a professional experience"
Do you not do research before getting a permanent body mod?
[deleted]
Imagine making a permanent change to your body and not examine the artists past work first
"First off anyone that does those deals aren‚Äôt busy artists so that should say a lot about the shop and them. And Wrapping in saran wrap and tape is old school. Normally done if not a lot of blood, And if I thought at any point they aren‚Äôt sanitary I would‚Äôve just left like wrapping your machine is number 1 you should of just got up and left."
it was a flash deal
my gf & i got a tattoo from precious slut for last year‚Äôs friday the 13tg flash sale & the ‚Äúartist‚Äù that she got botched her tat soo bad ( my artist did pretty good on mine ) . hers looked okay at first but it‚Äôs been over a year that she got it & its really thick ( was supposed to be a fine line flower ) & made her skin risen . i agree on the sanitation tho . everything is jus rushed & a mess
My Precious Slut lip tat has been immaculate for 6 years
Damn. I got a tattoo there 10 years ago when I went to school and they were decent back then.
"I got my eyebrow pierced there once and they were actually super nice and it healed well. Granted, he was smoking a cart but overall it was a good experience‚Ä¶can‚Äôt speak for the quality of their tats tho‚Ä¶"
Ya I don‚Äôt think anyone needed a warning. It‚Äôs a widely accepted opinion that people like their artist to be sober when permanently tattooing them
Jumping on this comment to recommend 805 Ink and specifically @ChadillacGreen IG handle. A great tattooer with incredibly reasonable pricing. I‚Äôve gotten my last 6 or 7 tattoos from him and he is just outstanding. All have healed perfectly well too.
"I heard good things about Above & Beyond! They use only body safe materials like 316 SS or titanium, whereas Precious Slut uses cheap unknown metal alloys that can cause issues."
"Honestly, it is hidden and I hardly ever notice it so I don't mind too much, and it's kinda a fun souvenir from my IV days."
"I saw her portfolio! It‚Äôs not really my style, I prefer traditional but she‚Äôs talented nevertheless. Hopefully she‚Äôll divert people away from Precious Slut."
"Got a silly small tattoo from her, and she is very polite and quick! I‚Äôd recommend her she has a lot of skill already"
"I got two small tattoos done by her in 2022, she‚Äôs great! They look exactly like what I asked for! I have also gotten a tattoo from previous slut in 2017, but the tattoo artist who did it for me moved to Vegas. Her name is sandy! She was wonderful and the tattoo is coming on 7 years old and has help up really well, but yeah the other artists there I don‚Äôt know about‚Ä¶"
Thanks for this!!
"Hey, I deserve all the shitting on. At least it is in a not-so-visible spot."
"I was in IV like 20 years ago when ‚ÄúPrecious Slut‚Äù first opened and it was a bad idea then, too."
"They used to have a good artist there, he works at a studio downtown now"
No reputable piercer will pierce a drunk person. WTF is going on?
Their Friday the 13th ‚Äúspecial‚Äù artist
I live downtown so I usually go to Golden Eagle and 805 ink. Precious Slut really should be out of business lol
"A wise man once said: Get ripped off once and you're just unlucky. Twice, and you're VERY unlucky. But three times, and you're an idiot."
"Not blaming anyone, just warning everyone else"
"It was my first tattoo, every one I have gotten since then has been much better."
Maybe just let people do what they want
ü§ì
Who hurt you bro
"I think your girlfriend's tattoo was overworked, the ""artist"" went too deep which lead to blowouts (makes lines look thick and uneven) and scarring (the raised skin). On mine the ""artist"" went too shallow so the lines look spotty but at least there's no scarring or anything."
Doing weed while on the job... sounds like Precious Slut behavior
"I never said the ""artist"" was drunk?"
I‚Äôve seen his work and it‚Äôs impressive!
"yeah above & beyond is pricey but i feel like it‚Äôs extremely worth it. my body is prone to rejecting piercings but literally the ONLY piercings i‚Äôve gotten from above & beyond are the ones that have stayed. they also just give really solid advice in general

also im so sorry abt the tat!"
"They just ain‚Äôt reputable üò≠ 

I feel like messing up a body part at Precious Slut was almost a rite of passage at UCSB. They got a bunch of my group over the years, lmao"
Not to be an ass or sound condescending but subjecting yourself to a Friday the 13th tattoo is just something you should never do ever that's not you getting ripped off that's you just not wanting to put the money in time into a quality tattoo. You got what you paid for not ripped off
Oh so you‚Äôre posting about this 19 tattoos later?
"Lol, back in my home town there was this tattoo shop where they all smoked on the job but they did amazing tattoos. So I think it‚Äôs just depends on the artist tbh"
"No I didn‚Äôt mean in your case in particular but the artists there are notorious for being unsanitary and doped out.
I got a piercing there once and the guy was so high he couldn‚Äôt get the back of the earring in and dropped it on the floor 3 times."
"what most people don‚Äôt realize is that piercings are a luxury and any shop promoting $20 piercings is not a safe shop to go to have things literally shoved in your body lol

and this is coming from someone who used to go to swap meets to get piercings üò≠ I have learned my lesson lmao"
"I am considering getting my first piercing, not sure where but i might just start with a classic lobe piercing and I will definitely go to Above & Beyond, they seem like they are worth it."
I agree! I think Precious Slut just preys on gullible college students who don't know any better.
"It was my first tattoo, everything else I have on my body (I have a traditional sleeve on one arm and a bunch of stuff on the other) was done by better artists."
"Yeah, what's wrong with that?"
"Weed can enhance creativity, no wonder the Dutch have some pretty nice art and the Amsterdam Tattoo Museum."
this is so true!!
At this point Precious Slut might be worse than Claire's for piercings

Wanting to get experience into Chem Research with limited experience and classes taken
"I am a 2nd-year chemistry student and my grades have only recently begun to improve to where I believe it would be possible to try and apply to work in a lab. I unfortunately did not take academic life extremely seriously during freshman year so I am behind what I believe most other chem students my age are at (current GPA 3.1). Despite this, I want to do better and be more active in my department. I am only just now taking Organic Chemistry but want to know what I could do to start getting experience. I understand that it would be much more difficult in my case, but does anyone have any suggestions for what I can do to gain experience in the field?"
"Email professors whose work is genuinely interesting to you. Don't get too discouraged if you get a few nos, it's generally pretty easy to get a research position at UCSB provided you show initiative"
"There are 13 Chemistry projects in the Faculty Research Assistance Program (FRAP) directory:

[https://ucsb.my.site.com/urca/s/urad](https://ucsb.my.site.com/urca/s/urad)

Talk to the professor and tell him/her your story.  Despite what you might think, not every professor was a prodigy as an undergrad.  Many of them had the same struggles as you."
Reach out to MRL faculties and see who has an opening in their labs.
Thank you for the suggestion I‚Äôll look into that!

Physical Therapy On Campus

I got in touch with DSP and the advisor assured me that there is a good chance that I can get the remote class option. In addition, most of my teachers have been very helpful as I continue to talk to them, saying that they‚Äôll post lecture notes online and that most of the course will be online, so even if I don‚Äôt get DSP, it won‚Äôt be the end of the world.

That being said, has anyone had any experience with the physical therapy offered here? Would it be worth the effort to switch physical therapy from LA to here in order to stay on campus and keep my focus on school, or would it be better just trying to cope at home? Any advice would be welcome."

Can I ask a professor to get access to the course page/materials when I'm not enrolled in their course?
"If so, do I have to ask them to be able to ""audit"" the course and ask for an enrollment code?"
"Yes. Profs can add you to canvas regardless of your enrollment. 

As long as there is physical room in the classroom, the majority of professors are open to students auditing their class if they show interest in the subject and would not otherwise take the course during your time at UCSB.

If this is a class you plan to take in the future, you can try to audit, but it‚Äôs less likely you‚Äôll get permission.

Good luck!"

Hi! I‚Äôm retaking chem 1B this quarter and i‚Äôm wondering if anyone knows of any TAs or ppl in the community that do 1:1 tutoring? I‚Äôm looking for 1-2 hours a week! Thanks :)
I got you. Hit me up on vinniesmith003@gmail.com
Soc 146 w/ Hajjar
Does anyone know what the topic is for this class?
does anyone have prof yan z x email
i need to send him an email and i did not get his email today! need his email or the syllabus for math 3B with yan pls ü§û
Did you try looking on the Math department website?
Professor Yan‚Äôs email is ztyan@ucsb.edu. I had him last quarter and got the email from the syllabus
thank you for the advice!! i found a zetian yan but i‚Äôm not 100% sure if it‚Äôs him and i don‚Äôt want to send an email to the wrong professor ü•≤ should i maybe do it anyways idk
thank you so so much!!
look at his cv. has he taught the class before?
Has anyone taken the wine class at the rec?
"If so, what was your experience?"
It's so fun if it's the same guy teaching it as Spring '19 you are in for a wild ride
"I attended the end of quarter tasting downtown as a plus one. Ended up closing down the bar with the professor and a few students, by the end he was uncorking nice ports and sherries. I forget what happened next but later I was rudely awoken from a nap in a bush on the sidewalk. 10/10 would recommend."
I never saw it actually taught during my time there unfortunately :(
"Geissinger, French guy?"
">French guy?

Checks out"
That's the one
"Had him for physics.  Guy‚Äôs stories were insane. Told us that we should never bring your own alcohol to a bar, because one time he did, blacked out, and woke up naked in an elderly woman‚Äôs bed. 

If y‚Äôall have any stories, pls lmk.  Been trying to hunt them down."
Are my classes ass?

What is Jewish dream interp?!? Never heard of that
One of my favorite classes was with Wolfson. He‚Äôs a very knowledgeable and accomplished scholar in the niche Jewish mysticism realm.
idk we in jewish dream tho
depends on what u mean by ass. it‚Äôs not a hard schedule if that‚Äôs what u mean.
"wolfson is pretty old and weird at times and hes very pretentious, but his classes have been some of my favorite at ucsb content wise"
"These look super, super cool and also Stephanie Batiste is an awesome lady."
‚ÄúJewish Dream Interpretation‚Äù sounds pretty cool
no lets be friends lol
12 units? You‚Äôll be fine right?
"I won‚Äôt comment on his teaching style aside from that he‚Äôs an oral lecturer with no PowerPoints, but Wolfson made a girl cry in Jewish Mysticism last quarter for having a bottle of juice in class. Yes I‚Äôm being fr. This was 2 days after he **berated** my best friend for ‚Äòbeing on her phone‚Äô when she was pulling up readings he was referencing on her cell since her iPad died. It‚Äôs a miracle she didn‚Äôt cry either. I would have. From what I know this is his last quarter before retiring, and boy does he need that time off."
I‚Äôm not joking I missed first day of Jewish dream what did we do
It‚Äôs a pre-requisite for Advanced Calculus
Like are they hard? I heard the professors weren‚Äôt good
The prof said everyone gotta wear a yamaka to bed for hw
Which is a prereq for Ling 135: Meme Theory
"dk anything abt the english class but afaik 5A is chill and i think i have a friend who took the third one and said it was chill (im not 100% sure it was that class though). 

regardless, u should be fine if it‚Äôs just 12 units even if the classes were hard"
Thank you glizzy!
"Bike too tall, anyone down to trade?"
"I bought a used bike over the break but my friend picked it up for me so I wasn‚Äôt able to test it out before I bought it. When I got back to sb the seat was too high up to ride (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7) even after adjusting the seat. If anyone has a bike that‚Äôs too short for them and would be open to trading let me know! My bike is in rly good condition, despite being used."
Big bikes are more comfortable when you get used to them. I‚Äôd suggest try it for a few days. If you can push the pedal all the way down you‚Äôll be just fine.
econ 185 vs econ 138a
has anyone heard anything about these courses? i‚Äôm enrolled in both and thinking about dropping one of them since i have a pretty heavy workload in my other classes. Richter teaches 138a and fulkerson teaches 185
"i would probably keep 185. i heard it's a really coveted class because it does more to teach you the systems you will actually be using on the job, as opposed to something like wileyplus. also probably depends on what youre doing in the future"
Changing professors
Is it possible to change professors of the same course. They both have different days for sections and the one I want to switch to is more convenient for me.
"If there is space on the class yes. If the class is full/has an existing waitlist, then probably not."
does anyone know how to change the unit number for internships
"taking econ 93 internship w hartman which is suppose to be 2 units but says 1 on my gold, and got an email telling me to change it but no instructions üò≠üò≠
"
There should be a ‚ÄúModify‚Äù option on the schedule in GOLD that will allow you to change the units.
It‚Äôs not letting me change mine either. Usually there is a modify button but it won‚Äôt click this time. Any luck?
There was an issue with the Modify button in GOLD that was just fixed a few minutes ago.  You should be able to change that course's units now.
"The Modify button was broken and was just fixed, so it should be accessible now."
Looking for 1 subleaser (4 people 2 rooms house on Abrego road) Spring Quarter- $825/month

You can sublease for the spring quarter and summer quarter also."
Messaged
"I kinda need this for this quarter, winter. It still available??"
Spring Quarter Classes
Anyone know when Spring quarter classes/professors gonna be up on GOLD?
"Hello,

I hope you are doing well. At the moment, this information is not available. However, I would advise you to follow [this](https://registrar.sa.ucsb.edu/calendars/calendars-deadlines/registration-pass-dates/2023-2024-registration-pass-times) website.

Have a good night and a great start to your Winter Quarter!"
"Replying to this thread. Spring Quarter classes will be available on January 29, 2024."
Any easy courses to take?
"As the title states, I am currently looking for easy, open courses to take for this semester. I realized that my professors, on rate my professor, aren't that good. I recently just finished my GE's and now I'm taking classes for credits. Does anyone know any courses I can get easily or classes that are free grades? A waitlist would also work too."
4 hours and no one has said organic chemistry yet!?
Definitely try any CS classes Kevin Burk offers.
"Econ 9 with benelli, psych 1 with tamsin german"
Econ 10a u won't regret it
CS 170

"Econ 9 with Benelli was very easy for me, got an A skipping most classes."

Looking for 4th roommate for IV apartment for the 2024-2025 year
I'm in a group of three guys looking to lease an apartment in IV next year and we're looking for a fourth. The units we're looking at are at the border of IV - right next to campus. The rent is around $1250/month per person and the lease signing is January 10th. Let me know if you're interested.
Sent you a pm
w24 excess unit load
does anyone know if it's still possible to apply for excess unit load for w24?
Why are there only 25 Area F courses offered this Winter?
"Hundreds of courses listed as counting towards Area F, yet a GOLD search for Area F courses offered this quarter(even though it'd be too late to get one rn obviously, that's not the point) shows only... 25 Area F courses.  Where the F\*\*\* are all the art courses??? For future reference, should I not expect to get spots in Area F courses at UCSB and take it at a CC instead?"
"There‚Äôs more like 2-3 courses you can actually take if you are not in the respective majors. That being said, stuff like Art 1A, some architecture classes, or random film, writing, etc. are offered every quarter so it‚Äôs best to try to get them Pass 1 if you really need it.

I agree there should be more options for people trying to fulfill GEs though"
There is zero coordination for when GE‚Äôs appear.   Departments independently decide their curriculum plan for the year usually without planning out how GE‚Äôs attached to courses are distributed.  You might try asking a prof to support a petition for a course to count.
"I can't answer to the lack of offerings, but UC Online typically has a good amount of courses every quarter."
Waitlist question?
"Im currently 3rd on the lecture waitlist and 1 on TWO section waitlists, do I only need to get off the section waitlist to get into the class or do I have to wait for 3 more people to drop before I can get into the section?"
i'm like 95% sure it's the section waitlist
Section waitlist
MCDB 1LL
"Do you need to be also enrolled with EEMB 2LL for this class??

&#x200B;"
"No. I don't even think EEMB 2LL is offered in winter, it's usually in Spring. The only prerequisite for MCDB 1LL is MCDB 1A."
UCSB vs UCLA Physics (Transfer)
"Applied to both, applied for CCS Physics, If I get into that I‚Äôm defo going there. But if I don‚Äôt get into ccs what are the pros and cons of the physics and both schools? 

Current interest is in condensed matter, particularly superconductors. Though ofc that‚Äôll change at least somewhat through undergrad."
"UCSB Physics is very good, at least top 10 in the country."
Gravity is higher here
"UCSB physics is unmatched. Especially when it comes to research opportunities for undergrads. Condensed matter is also particularly good at UCSB considering we have the MRL and professors like Andrea Young

I got into both schools and ended up doing L&S physics at UCSB for the program."
"While it is true that the rankings are for grad-school and research and not undergraduates, the fact that the program for physics and research here is really good means that you will develop arguably stronger connections here than La for physics. 


Plus since you seem interested in condensed matter and semiconductors, SB has some of the best researchers in both fields, and you can even conduct research in the materials department."
"I‚Äôm a CCS physics student, and I can‚Äôt tell you how much I love it. The class size is super small, and the professors are extremely dedicated. Research is easily accessible as well. Plus, if you are thinking about graduate school, CCS is a super good program. Around 75% percent of students attend graduate school, with around 50% going to places like Ives. I can‚Äôt recommend enough. If you get into CCS, go to ucsb. If you get in general admission, it‚Äôs your choice to make."
If you can choose between UCSB and UCLA always choose UCLA. no brainer
I would avoid UCSB for the shitty quality of life here. Cheers.
Seems like that. KITP seems like a pull as well.
"Do you mind if I dm you to ask you a bit more in depth about it? I've already conversed with Dr. B fairly extensively, and he offered to put me in contact with a few current CCS students."
"This is not true, especially for Physics. UCSB‚Äôs physics department is world class"
"Disagree

UCSB has better research groups for physics and OP can prob get stronger rec letters here. UCLA only really has the stronger name brand for non-physics people, which can be helpful if they want a professional job after graduation. If OP wants to do graduate school that wont really matter. 

Anecdotally, you meet people in physics, environmental, and engineering that turned down UCLA"
someone doesnt like dlg
"Anyways CCS physics shouldn‚Äôt be too different than the regular physics major, in that it‚Äôs still worth it to come here for physics imo even without CCS"
Very true. Tons of smart people who choose the program here because it has a top tier program with awesome research
Rec Cen Passport Renewal
does anyone know if the red cen office still does passport renewals?
"Yes, but they are completely booked out for the next few weeks, so you'll have to keep checking to see when they release new appointments.  It's not a solution for someone who needs one quickly.

Offering organic chemistry tutoring
If you are going to take CHEM 109A or 109B with Lewis this winter quarter I will be offering tutoring. I am a 3rd-year student who was pretty successful with the series and enjoys the subject a lot. You can send me a message here and then we can contact on e-mail or other means. I charge 25/h. 
Courseload for ENGL 10 and POLI SCI 15
"Anyone who has taken one of these courses know the course load for those classes are, just curious since I plan to take one of those courses this upcoming quarter."
"I took POLI SCI 15 during summer. I think the workload is fair but I have some programming experience, if you don't have any experience with statistic/code, I would say it's time consuming as POL 15 is mostly about statistic and programming."
Lasw cc online much easier & grade won‚Äôt affect ucsb gpa
How to do well in CHEM 109-B?
"Currently shaking in my boots, I'm taking lewis for chem 109b and I'm a transfer, so this is my first ochem course here. Any advice appreciated! üò≠"
"Enroll in a CLAS tutorial group!  Bhavandeep Dillon‚Äôs group took me from a D to a B-.  If I was with it for the entire qtr, I think I could‚Äôve gotten an A.
CLAS is worth its weight in gold."
"Lewis is cool, definitely go in to office hours if you‚Äôre struggling. But the thing I found most helpful in the ochem series (all of chem actually) was doing as many practice problems as possible. The difficulty of the tests is not that far off from the questions you‚Äôll find in the textbook"
When I took 109b I thought it was the hardest in the series but looking back it really all comes down to pattern recognition. It‚Äôs basically a bunch of carbonyl chemistry and a lot of it follows the same general concepts even if the reacting molecules/products are diff. I think doing practice problems is really helpful so you learn the core principles behind the reactions! I didn‚Äôt ever use CLAS but I know it really helped a lot of my friends
Parking permit commuter
Is anyone else still waiting for approval? I really don‚Äôt want to have to buy individual day passes or the 30 day pass. I was dumb and bought a fall quarter only pass because I didn‚Äôt want to spend too much money. Should have bought one for the whole school year. Now school starts on Monday I think?? Still a little confused about that. But either way I haven‚Äôt been approved for a permit yet.
Give them a call and they should be able to approve u on the spot
Class does start on Monday
Thank you!
English 104LC vs Philosophy 100D?
I'm planning on dropping one but im not sure which one. Has anyone taken these and can give any input? This is my last GE so I'm just looking for something that won't be horrible. Boscagli is teaching English and Roskies is teaching philosophy 
104LC is a new course and idk if it's even been taught before so you're probably not going to be able to get much insight beyond someone having taken 104A/B in general.
Don‚Äôt see Physics 6B/BL canvas course
I don‚Äôt see these courses on canvas yet. Does anybody have theirs loaded in?
"I have 2 courses that are unpublished but on Canvas, they kinda waiting until last minute huh? Making me nervous lol"
Piercings nearby?
"Thinking about getting a nose piercing, where should I go in Goleta/downtown SB? Or maybe even in IV? Thanks :))"
Above and beyond which is located above golden eagle in downtown! My piercer moved and told me that‚Äôs the only place they recommend
"I‚Äôve been told septum ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt hurt‚Äù but it DEF did for me. Felt like a bad vaccination, but in the nose, and it took about 10 seconds of that pain, then it was angry for three hours and I was suddenly scared of strangers attacking me because they can now just aim for my nose and I will suffer

Worth it tho. Would I do it again?‚Ä¶ yeah if I had a nose that could accommodate two I def would get a second one cause that would be sick as hell üòÇ"
Haven't been there myself but wanted to add they're the only place in the area that's a part of the association of professional piercers which is what you should be looking at when searching for a piercer.
This is the only answer you need
if your septum hurt they pierced it wrong!!!
"Oh, well, considering he pulled it back out halfway to make it go out from a diff place after he had already achieved full penetration‚Ä¶ yeah I guess he did do it wrong. He assured me he had 10 years of experience and no complaints so I assumed that was what was supposed to happen"
Where should I buy a used bike?
"Where should I buy a used bike?
Are there any sites or anyone who tries to sell it?"
"Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and OfferUp! Make sure you check the distance of the bike, and hit up multiple listings that catch your eye (there‚Äôs no guarantee that one seller will reply). Also, most, if not all of the time, you‚Äôll have to purchase your own lock separately."

ABSN programs requirements
"Hii I am currently a first year pre-bio major planning on changing to brain and psych. I recently discovered I truly want to do nursing and seeing as UCSB does not offer thag I plan on completing my bachelors and applying accelerated BSN programs. I have been researching their eligibility and most require 4 semester credit hours of gen chem with lab. I know that Chem 1A is 3u and lab is 2, so would it count as 5 units together? However, some programs also state that gen Chen 2 can not substitute gen Chen 1. I am a little confused as to how many gen chem classes plus labs I would need to take at UCSB to fulfill that?"
"This link might help you figure out which courses are needed, courtesy of the UCSB Pre-Health advising center. 

https://healthsciences.duels.ucsb.edu/tracks/careers/nursing"
u would probably need to take gen chem + lab entire series.

Random upper divs
Is it normal to have stupid ass random upper divs just to get the credit? Any classes I take that aren‚Äôt major classes are stupid and im just taking for the credit and I feel like im wasting my time or doing something wrong lol
You can either take random classes or attempt to get a minor. It‚Äôs just how the system is set up
"No cuz I can‚Äôt take any other upper div in my major yet even though I‚Äôm in the full major. I want to take some random upper div for credit cuz the graduation requirement for upper div is more than what the major UD classes offer. Anyways, What classes are you looking at? Cuz I want do the same lol"
"Just find the easiest upper divs available and take them pass/no pass, that way you don‚Äôt need to stress about the grade"

Avoid StudentRoomStay on Abrego. Horrible management.
"loads open in early january!! sierra properties has SO many open to apply rn. EIPM might have a few, Wolfe should have a few, and Bartlein should be opening soon‚Ä¶unsure about Meridian"
You‚Äôre not doomed! Plenty of companies open leasing early January! https://pardallcenter.as.ucsb.edu/isla-vista-community-resource-guide/housing-in-isla-vista/leasing-companies/ check out this link and look through all the leasing companies!

start praying for campus housing
"There‚Äôs 3 main pages/groups I know of: GIRLS IV housing, BOYS IV housing, and then just SBCC/UCSB housing page."
"If Sandra and Aerial were removed from the company I truly think that that place could have so much potential. Well, that and if they hired a maintenance person, new management, and fixed their lease fraud issues."
"You dodged a bullet! I would have actually SAVED money by breaking the lease compared to now. They lost payments and overcharged and slapped on fees that they can‚Äôt even identify. 

I'm drained from battling for basic housing rights. Multiple residents, including myself, are resorting to lawyers/attorneys to continue fighting our battles. Beware of deceptive tours, empty promises, and lease fraud.

Some of us are living without adequate heat, despite full rent costs. Isla Vista dips down into the 30¬∞s during winter. We are in the second month of advocating for heat. 

The manager's commitments to address issues are a ploy. There are false promises of amenities like a pool, gym, and a parking gate. Privacy violations are rampant‚Äîunannounced entries into residents' units, leading to disturbing encounters. When confronted, the manager denies any wrongdoing, leaving residents frustrated.

Maintenance is nonexistent, contrary to what was assured on the lease. ""Student ambassadors"" replace on-site management, tasked with inappropriate duties for minimal rent breaks. The tasks they tell them to do are wrong even by a moral standpoint. 
Residents' payment records are misplaced, leading to unnecessary charges and residents having to demand corrections. Rather than correcting fees they would rather argue about what lead to the errors/charges. 

Despite the exorbitant rent, unjustified fees are imposed, and promises of waived fees are unreliable at best. They overcharged me around $1000, and the refund process is ongoing and agonizingly slow. International students, one of the primary targets of StudentRoomStay, are particularly vulnerable. There is a reason there are so many vacancies! 

The claimed 5-star reviews seem dubious. I haven't encountered a satisfied resident here. We feel isolated, exploited, and exhausted fighting for basic tenant rights."
"I have a ton of specific examples If you want to DM me, I just don‚Äôt want to share too many specifics publicly of peoples stories as the details are honestly disgusting."
"There is a website but it's for business, not rentals. The rentals are by word-of-mouth so you have to call and ask. Just ask to speak to Mr. Mendez. 805-963-3117"
Let‚Äôs pray for the JAPANSES
"This ain‚Äôt the first time they messed up their emails. Really curious about who is running OISS cuz I genuinely haven‚Äôt seen no improvement in years. International students deserve better than this, at least not when people are losing homes and families."
I have a friend  from Ishikawa who has family there when the earthquake hit. I'm trying to contact with her through LINE but haven't gotten any word back. I'm really hoping her family is alright. She's one of the greatest friends I've ever met while we were in UCSB

Where can I park my car at ucsb ?
"I am living in ucsb‚Äôs university apartments for this year but I couldn‚Äôt get a parking permit for San Joaquin. I literally tried to get one in the fall however they denied me because I was studying abroad. They told me I had to apply later on toward the end of fall quarter which I did. I am on the waitlist still and haven‚Äôt moved a position. I need my car at SB because I frequently go home due to family reasons. I emailed UCSB TPS but have gotten no response. 

The winter quarter is starting soon and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I still have to move in my stuff. I don‚Äôt mind paying for parking somewhere else but I do not know how to find parking. Does anyone know what I should do or who I should talk to? Any help is appreciated!!!"
"I‚Äôm terms of contacting TPS, I would call them. That‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôve gotten help. There‚Äôs been times I‚Äôve had to call 5 times back to back to get someone to answer, but once they do I‚Äôve always gotten help."

help w self administered injections
does anyone have experience with medical injections and feel really comfortable with a small syringe needle thing? ive never self administered and im scared lol I ill legit pay someone pls 
"Go to student health / a local doctor or nurse and have them help you out and show you how to do it.  Once you learn to do it, it won‚Äôt be scary!  You got this!"
"Diabetes?whoever is prescribing treatment should be showing you how to do this. They will make sure you are comfortable self injecting, needle safety etc."
"it‚Äôs not as bad as it seems, you can do it!
but as someone else said you can go to student health and have a nurse show you how to do it for the first time"
Is experience required?
Idk if we use the same type but I use one of the self-insert ones!! For me it‚Äôs just a slow push down and it‚Äôs a little prick/hurty but it‚Äôs genuinely not as bad as it seems
"I used to be on Humira self injections in the stomach and it really freaked me out too. The way I was able to get it done was I would have a friend/family member squeeze part of my legs increasingly harder and harder and I would tell them to keep doing it until I did the injection. At some point it just hurts more than your will to not do the injection. Maybe that‚Äôs super weird but it worked for me and I would always be able to get my injections done in under a minute that way. I also had times where I would ice the area for like 20 minutes first and it kind of helped too since you can‚Äôt feel it as much, and I would also sometimes do like a Group FaceTime with out of town friends and have them watch and it also kind of helped since they were all supportive and curious about how it worked"

"is the econ and accounting major flexible? Ive read on here that you should only major in it if you‚Äôre planning on directly going to head into accounting. I was thinking of double majoring in applied math and econ, but I don‚Äôt know whether I should pair it pure econ or econ and accounting. The problem is that idk what to do yet, im indifferent to accounting, but still considering it. Yet I still have interest in a lot of different areas like becoming a quant or financial analyst. 

Or should I just major in solely FMS (Financial Mathematics and Statistics) instead?"
"The main thing I can say is that it's preparing you to become an accountant. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I think that understanding the accounting process could be invaluable to another field. I'm biased though, I graduated from with Econ Accounting. I'd try to get in touch with an econ department advisor and set up a meeting. My strategy is email a few faculty people who sound like who you should be talking to and they'll direct you to the right person if not."
"A post I can speak to! I doubled in Financial Math & Stats and Bus Econ with Accounting. I initially went into quant finance and I felt the accounting gave me an edge but didn‚Äôt exactly pop-up in my day-to-day work. Accounting has also really helped me with my personal portfolio and taught me to read financial statements (since I prefer to trade largely based on fundamentals in my personal portfolio). 

Quant is incredibly difficult to break into from this background though and you‚Äôll be missing the CS skills that are mandatory. You‚Äôd have to work pretty hard to build up your programming skills and you‚Äôd need a masters from a top Financial Engineering program and/or a PhD in CS, Physics, or maybe mathematics/statistics. 

If you want to go a more econometrics route, then skip accounting and do just Econ and mathematics. If you want financial analyst or if you go for any corporate finance route, then go for accounting."
Roommate for 2024-2025 school year
"I‚Äôm looking for a roommate for the next academic year, and am open to either filling a space or looking for housing together. Ideally I‚Äôd like to join a pre-existing lease but I‚Äôm also applying to some places to keep all bases covered! My budget is $800-$900 per person for rent, and I don‚Äôt have a car so don‚Äôt need a parking space. I‚Äôm going to be a third year next year, and work on the weekends. Let me know if you‚Äôd like to talk more!"
"Hey! I'm down to talk, feel free to dm me"
"Hey, I‚Äôm also looking for a roommate!"
"Hey, shoot me a message, I'm looking for a roommate too"
Can‚Äôt get into Facebook Housing Groups
I‚Äôve been requesting to get into the ucsb housing groups on Facebook since the beginning of last month. But none of them are accepting my requests. Is anyone else having the same issue? Any clue what I can do?
Do you have a profile photo on your account? A lot of spam accounts try to get onto the groups so sometimes they automatically reject ones that could be suspicious
I do but it‚Äôs a picture of a random cute painting I found online. Should I change it to a picture of me?
I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe you can find out who the moderators are of the pages and DM them?
"Send me a message privately of a link to your profile, I might be able to ‚Äúinvite‚Äù you to the groups."
"for housing groups you're going to want a ""regular"" profile pic (of yourself) anyways so that people can identify you. when i was looking for roommates/subleases i never responded to people without a profile pic of themselves"
Alright.
Econ 10A
"Is section mandatory? If it's not, is it helpful at all? What's the attendance like?"
try searching this sub.
"Hello, 

I hope you are doing well. From my personal experience with ECON 10A, sections were not mandatory. During the section, the TA guided us through the weekly problem sets that were posted on (then) GauchoSpace, which assisted us with concepts covered for that week. Attendance declined as the weeks advanced with a slight increase in attendance when exams were going to occur. Personally, I thought they were helpful, albeit some might not think so. I hope this personal insight helps. Have a great weekend, and best of luck in ECON 10A!"
"Coming from someone who just took the class and got an A-, sections were not mandatory. However, I would highly recommend jumping around the different sections and finding a TA that provides a mini lecture explaining how to work out the problem sets and attend every single section. It will help prepare you for the exams; with the class being weighed heavily toward exams, you‚Äôre going to need to do well on them"
"Your mileage may vary, for what it's worth though I had an 8 am section and skipped nearly every single week in the Fall quarter. On the flip side I went to tutoring throughout the quarter. Ended up just barely getting a B in the class. All they did in my section was some practice problems every week. That's it."
"Didn‚Äôt go to section after week 2,ended with an A in the class. Just do all the practice problems and actually understand them. I don‚Äôt have the link, but other Reddit posts have a link to another Reddit post with YouTube videos explaining each problem set by an awsome tutor. GL"
"agreed ‚Äî but I will say they were only helpful as long as the TA going over the problem sets was able to explain it properly. section is not mandatory and you don‚Äôt have to go to your assigned TA‚Äôs section either. my advice would be to go to your TA‚Äôs section the first week and if they aren‚Äôt helpful to you, try going to the other TA sections to see if the way they teach it is better."
Yep! This is something that I forgot to mention. It's very important to do this as well!
Showers at school (not in dorms)
My hot water got shut off and I won‚Äôt have it back until Monday. Is there anywhere at school where I could shower?
Rec Cen
Nothing like a 4 am lagoon bath
The library but you have to bring ur own water bottle üëç
The old (Robb) gym has showers but they added electric locks a couple years ago because the homeless discovered it. You have to wait for someone to leave to get in if you're not an athlete.
"Rec Cen has universal locker rooms that are private and nice, they‚Äôre eat the cycling bikes facing the field"
i cant tell if this is a joke
bubble bathü§≠üßº
Yessir rub on some fresh dirt and algae for exfoliationüòåüòå
You can just ask for the key from the testing office in the building. They will just ask for it back sometimes it‚Äôs just on the desk
they have private showers in the rec cen
that's dope
Math 34B Section
Is anyone willing to switch to Thursday 7pm section from a Thursday 6pm section? I desperately need to switch to a 6pm section instead.
CMPSC 64 Section Switch
"I‚Äôm currently enrolled in the Tuesday 5-5:50 section but I didn‚Äôt realize it conflicts with one of the classes I just got off the waitlist for. If anyone would want to switch section times with me it would be life saving!!! üôèüôèüôè

EDIT: I‚Äôm so desperate I‚Äôd be willing to pay üíÄüíÄüíÄ a homie just tryna graduate on time"
Looking for someone to sublet spot in apartment for Spring Quarter/Summer
"Hello, I (21F) am graduating early and hope to move away after winter quarter ends, but would need someone to sublet my spot in a 1-bedroom apartment on Embarcadero del Mar for the Spring/Summer until my lease is up the first week of September. Rent is only $750/month + utilities (usually lower than $50 per person). Please contact me if interested! Women/enbies only please :)"
Is this a single unit or is there another person and you both have beds in the one bedroom?
There is another person and right now we share the room. However the living room area is pretty big and would be able to fit a bed if you wanted it separate
CMPSC 9 section switch
Im currently taking CMPSC 9 this winter quarter with KHARITONOVA and have a 1pm section. However I have a time conflict with this section time. Is anyone down to switch sections with me? If so pls hmu üôèüèº
Section for cs classes are typically just extra office hours to help with labs I think you‚Äôd be fine going to any other section
TMP Fundamentals of Finance
I want to take TMP Fundamentals of Finance through the PACE extension program for the last class to complete the technology management minor but I was wondering if that class counts toward my ucsb units for financial aid? or do i need to take 3 regular ucsb classes and the other class?
3 regular classes + the pace class to be considered full time
Financial aid office phone number
"Hi, does anyone know our school‚Äôs financial aid office phone number?"
"Contact info is here: [https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/contact-us](https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/contact-us)

The office is normally swamped so any cold call in wouldn't likely be attended too properly so join the queue or email them."
"There is no number, they just have the queue to join online to get a call."
Struggling with choosing a major
"I'm currently a freshman majoring in Pre-Statistics and Data Science, but I'm uncertain if I like this major. Some people have mentioned that the curriculum for this program isn't very good. I've also heard that UCSB is quite renowned for its 'Economics and Accounting' major. Therefore, I'm considering switching to this major and minoring in 'Statistical Science' (as I believe these two are a good combination???). However, I'm concerned that it might be too late to switch during the spring quarter. None of the courses I've taken or selected meet the requirements for the Economics and Accounting major, and I heard that it's very difficult to enroll in classes for this major:( Additionally, I'm wondering if Economics and Accounting might lead to more job opportunities than Statistics and Data Science, potentially with a lower salary??? (I'm not very sure about this.) I would appreciate any advice on this matter:) Thank you!!!"
You should try Econ 3A before switching. You might not like accounting either. And it‚Äôs never too late to switch major as a first year.
"I switched my major so many times at UCSB. From Bio -> Econ & Acct -> FMS -> Stats & Data Science. I was able to make the last switch my junior year while studying abroad.

I mean, what do you enjoy doing? If you want to go into Big4, then do Econ & Accounting. Though I personally think the Stats degree is more versatile. It sounds (and is) more rigorous than Econ and the average person is more impressed with a technical degree. If you want a mix of both, do Financial Math & Stats. In terms of rigor, imo FMS is the hardest, followed by Stats & Data Science, and then Econ & Accounting.

I honestly enjoyed the curriculum for the stats major. You get a strong foundation of math and stats, and you have a bunch of different course offerings you can pick from for electives. At the undergrad level I don‚Äôt think it differs much between school anyways, we‚Äôre all getting taught the same things. What I hated was how disorganized the stats department was and I felt like it was difficult getting the classes I wanted. Even then I was able to graduate a quarter early.

Idk, I graduated in 2021 so it may be different now.

I think Econ & Accounting may lead to ‚Äúmore‚Äù job opportunities simply because there are more openings for accounting, audit, tax, etc. Also, UCSB does very well for B4 recruiting and it should be fairly straightforward to get a job out of college. For Stats, I‚Äôd agree it‚Äôs a bit harder to get that first job. There is a higher barrier to entry for careers like data analyst, data scientist, actuarial analyst, etc because you‚Äôre competing against people who have strong math and technical skills, and projects under their belt. Data is a hot field right now and everyone and their grandmother wants to enter the career. In terms of entry level pay, I think Stats will have a slightly higher pay compared to Econ. As you progress in your career it‚Äôs less about your degree and more about work ethic and ability to climb the corporate ladder. So, with either degree you can make 6 figures definitely. 

Whatever your interest lies in the most is where you will find success."
"Currently a stats major interested in finance. Most econ ppl I know plan to work after undergrad and many further studies are done in the workplace, with possibly a MBA a few years later. Stats ppl usually get a BA/financial engineering master or stats/math phd. I would say it depends on the level of empirical/quantitative and front/back office work you prefer."
It‚Äôs never too late more or less
"Currently Econ and Accounting third year, planning to work in big 4 accounting after i graduate. econ accounting is a rlly good option if you want stability post grad, most ppl i know have a big 4 internship and job lined up. the major is also good if you want to get into consulting and finance, try joining clubs like finance connection, uas, or even 180dc if thats what you wanna go into. if i was in your shoes, i would take econ 3a and see how i like it and make my choice from there. im happy to answer any questions just shoot me a pm :)"
"i switched my major in spring of my freshman year from psych to stats, you‚Äôll have to take some summer courses but it‚Äôs def doable so if you want to change now is the time"
A lot of data jobs will be heavily integrated with the use of AI within 5 ish years so it'll be harder to compete/stick out with other people trying to get in unless there's a way of showing your skills in conceptual/critical thinking. I think accounting is the way to go since it's less prone to being influenced by advancements in AI and thus not as strict of competition in entry level jobs. Also accounting interviews/hiring processes are more of judging your soft skills like communication and collaboration for accounting and they just teach you on the job so I would go for that route to stick out more
"I would reach out to a counselor about this lol, specifically, I'd reach out to the ugrad advisors for any and all majors/minors you're interested as well as your current major's advisor to ask their opinion of the best way/time to transfer/switch majors

Probably could also ask them if they have any insights into employment or who to ask/see about that. Career Services might help but idk if they have specific information regarding every/all majors."
"Economics and Accounting is a great major if you're looking to move into consulting, finance, or accounting (id recommend avoiding big 4 audit at all costs, unless you are somehow passionate about audit). you just need to pair it with the right internships to move in whatever career direction you would like, and it'll get you where you want to go! The salaries most likely will be lower than Data Scientist positions in Tech, which are possible to obtain with UCSB's program. One of my favorite tricks in asking the right people is to find people who are in a role you would like to pursue in the future on linkedin that studied at UCSB, see what they studied and their path to get there. And if you connect, you can even message them and pick their brain! You have plenty of time to figure this all out as well! dont stress and enjoy the ride"
"Just graduated as an Econ and Accounting major. Started as an Econ major but after completing the pre-reqs, I realized I hated Econ, so tried accounting and found it tolerable. Ended up actually enjoying it - the account professors are top notch imo. In terms of job opportunities, Econ and Accounting is an amazing feeder into public accounting. You don‚Äôt have to be involved in clubs or have related internships/jobs. They‚Äôll literally just scoop you up. As others have said, it‚Äôs nice stability and if you go into Big 4, you have so many future exit ops. I have lots of friends who are Econ majors and Stats and Data Science majors. Truthfully, the only ones that got jobs out of college are the ones who networked hella, very involved, and obviously smart. I think you can definitely skate by in Econ and Accounting without putting in work to get the job, but not rlly in other business/finance leading majors. In terms of pay, Stats and Data Science probs gonna pay a bit more entry level wise. But honestly it‚Äôs gonna equal out quickly"
Got it! I will try applying for the class!
"I came in pre-Econ and Accounting, got to Econ 3A, hated it, and immediately switched to Econ. 

Op, I‚Äôd recommend consideringswitching to Econ - UCSB‚Äôs Econ program is pretty quantitative / stats heavy (not much historical econ theory), so it might be a good fit for you. 

In terms of job opportunities, its a broadly applicable degree for most business/finance roles. I double majored in Econ / Geography, and now work for a consulting firm for real estate developers."
"Thank you for your comment! You've given me the idea to consider FMS. I haven't yet figured out what interests me in it, but I am choosing among STEM majors that I can handle. How can you be sure that Stats & DS is the right major for you, considering you've mentioned switching majors several times? Would you mind sharing your experience with me?"
Got it! I will do some research on relevant areas as I just only have a very shallow knowledge of this speciality
Wow! It seems that econ and accounting is a good major and gives me a little excited lol:) I will look up the clubs you mentioned. Thanks for your help!
"Yes! My brother said the same words as you, and this gives me the reason to switch my major, but the ceilings of data jobs are more higher than the accounting jobs imo, letting me not sure whether I should change my major."
This is a good idea; I even forgot I could reach out to the ugrad advisor to talk about it! Thanks![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|wink)
"Wow, it seems that networking is a great way to learn about a major! I just quite don't know how to network with alumni; it's very hard to step out the first step, but I will try my best to do it. Thanks for your advice!"
"I have heard that Economics and Accounting offer more job opportunities than Statistics and Data Science. This is because accounting and related jobs are somewhat traditional fields that many people are reluctant to pursue. This makes me worry that I won't be able to secure a high-paying job in the future. So, I am curious about your statement regarding how these two majors can quickly become equally well-paid."
[deleted]
Got it! I will try Econ 3A to see whether I like Econ&Acc. Thanks for your suggestion! Maybe Econ will be a great option for me; I will look up the information about this major:)
"No problem at all.

I had no clue what I wanted to pursue after college, so that's why I switched majors so many times. In high school I thought about becoming a Physician Assistant (hence the Bio major). Took AP Bio my senior year and realized after submitting college apps that I hated it lmao.

Did some research and thought maybe a career in Big4 could be promising. It seemed like the least difficult way to make a good living. So, the summer after graduating high school, I emailed someone at UCSB to petition a major change. Dove into the career some more, and honestly (don't mean to be a hater here), I felt like pursuing a career in Big4 was ""settling"" and I felt like I could achieve more. Don't get me wrong, I think that it's a great career path and they make decent money, but I didn't want to feel like I worked so hard in high school and college just to go into accounting. That same summer, I petitioned again to change majors to Financial Mathematics and Statistics. So I actually changed majors twice before I even started university.

The FMS degree is nice because you have to take Econ1, Econ2, and Econ10A. So you're being exposed to the fundamentals of economics. In addition to that, you're taking Calculus, Diff Eq, Linear Algebra, Probability, Programming, and a few proof-based math classes. It's a very well-rounded degree.

The only reason why I switched out of FMS is because of my study abroad program. I took MATH 104A (I think that's numerical analysis?) fall quarter of my junior year at UCSB. Winter & Spring quarter of my junior year, I was supposed to take the equivalent of MATH 104B and 104C at my exchange university to complete my numerical analysis requirement. But, when I was studying abroad I wasn't able to secure my spot in the class so I wouldn't be able to finish my requirements to graduate on time. That's the only reason why I switched out of the FMS major to Stats and Data Science. The MATH 104 series is not required for the Stats&DS degree.

Actually, I wish that I initially went with the Stats&DS degree instead of FMS. The course requirements are actually slightly easier because you have more wiggle room on the requirements. I also think you have more flexibility on your elective classes so you have more freedom to study what you want. For example, MATH 117 is a requirement for FMS but not for Stats&DS. MATH 117 is one of the most difficult courses at UCSB imo. (Although, I still suggest you take it because it gives you a very strong foundation in math and if you want to go to grad school it's a must you that take it). I just think it's easier to get a higher GPA for the Stats&DS major.

When you're applying for jobs, employers will not really differentiate between the FMS and the Stats degree. There's a ton of overlap between the two regardless. Both degrees sound ""smart"" to the average person and both show that you are able to handle rigor. Sorry, long story but I'm pretty happy with the major I chose. The stats department is a mess and annoying af, but I have since forgotten about it."
"Thats true about the ceiling, but I would ask other subreddits for better advice on career advancements. You should ask the accounting and data science subreddits. In this subreddit we're all students who are as unsure as you about the market and the ceiling value of jobs. 

I hear from other reddit posts about people who are data analysts who can't move up and stay there, having less pay and job security than Accounting jobs. Data Science and Machine learning jobs mostly require a masters or phd, and in this saturated market it seems everyone is trying to get a masters too. Data engineering jobs require you to know more of software engineering and cs, which our major doesn't teach."
"Yea accounting definitely offers more job opportunities. Public accounting has terrible turnover so they constantly need heads. That being said, because it‚Äôs so easy to get a job in audit/tax, especially from UCSB, you‚Äôre extremely expendable. Further, the firms constantly align salaries so they‚Äôre all in the same ball park. So the pay, while being comparatively strong to most entry level positions, is less than the analyst roles you can get with FMS or Stats & Data Science because those are definitely more difficult to get jobs. But, the exit ops of PA, especially Big 4, are really good and, imo, quickly catch up to analyst/IB roles"
hhhhhh I will keep an eye on this professor! Or any other recommended courses for letting me get know about accounting?
"Thank you so much for sharing your story! I have the same feeling as you; I think the ceiling in stats is higher than in accounting. I will do more research on these majors, just like you did, and connect with relevant people to make my final decision about my major:)"
I see. I will try my best to reach out the alumni from accounting and ds for better advice:) Thanks for your comments!
"After reading your words, I'm starting to feel a little tempted to switch my major to Econ and Accounting hhhh:) Does Econ and Accounting require coding courses?"
[deleted]
"Anytime!

What I did in college was search for alumni with those degrees on LinkedIn to see what they did after school.

I definitely think the ceiling in stats is higher than in accounting, and I think work life balance is better too. I‚Äôd guess people who go into consulting or big 4 accounting work 40-50 hours a week on average. Data analysts or similar fields work a bit less than that (like 30-40 hours a week). That‚Äôs just my personal experience though. It‚Äôs pretty chill over on this side"
"Nah. There‚Äôs 2 required Econ-focused stats classes. You also have one Econ elective of your choice, which could be econometrics related or coding related if you‚Äôd like. Or more directly related to Econ. Feel free to reach out about questions about the major, exit ops, etc :)"
Ono:( But I will try my best on this course
"Understood! If I have any question, can I dm you? Still, thanks for you advice:)"
[deleted]
"Yea ofc, sorry that‚Äôs wut I meant by feel free to reach out haha"
Why is it so hard to get into this program? Is it because it's hard to get into the program?

I see. This is kinda sucks:)
I will still take this major into consideration. Thanks for your comments!

Family Housing Choices
"Hello everyone! I am trying to decide between Storke and West Campus for housing as an incoming grad student. It would be just me, my preschooler son, and potentially another family member. Which housing choice is the better choice, cost aside? And with the better choice is  there a specific layout that‚Äôs better or are they generally the same? Thank you so much for your input."
"Storke is closer to campus, and more aesthetically pleasing from a curb appeal standpoint. The two floors are kinda cramped inside, but its got a light/airy outdoor feel.

West Campus are ugly, but may be more practical floorplans? I like the proximity to North Campus Open Space too.

Either way, it maybe be a bit of a wait (having a son helps, but I don't know if its instant still), so be prepared for other housing options."
"West Campus is super old. Like black mold old. Like sign an asbestos waiver old. 

Aside from being newer construction, Storke is far more likely to have more than one bedroom. 

Also, for West Campus, the playground area is across a parking lot, which is not the case for Storke. So if your kid is an independent play type, you may not want them running across a parking lot."
"Stork II is my strong recommendation if price isn‚Äôt a factor. I lived there for my PhD and it was a great apartment. 2nd floor Stork II if you can get one has vaulted ceilings, so it makes the spaces feel much bigger and roomier."
"I‚Äôve lived in both West Campus and now at Storke. I lived in the one bedroom and two bedroom apartments in West Campus and as everyone has said, they are older units but the rent is cheaper which is nice. I loved living next to the North Campus Open Space and trails out to the beach are literally in your backyard. West Campus is quieter and with more families that are couples who don‚Äôt have children (which is why it‚Äôs quieter). I didn‚Äôt mind the quiet. The two bedroom apartments are townhouses; they are not super spacious (it feels like the upstairs and downstairs are crammed on top of one another) and the bedrooms are right next to each other. However, I like that the hallways have windows and the lighting feels better in these. The bathrooms also have actual windows which make a huge difference. 

Storke is nicer in terms of curb appeal but it is more expensive by a couple hundred. It is also a bigger community with more families so it‚Äôs a bit louder with more families and kids running around (which I also don‚Äôt mind!). So it‚Äôs also livelier. It is closer to campus but there isn‚Äôt as much open space, just one trail behind Storke II which leads to a Main Street and undergrad housing. Storke only provides two bedroom apartments so you‚Äôll be guaranteed two bedrooms if you get one of those. They range from one floor apartments (with two bedrooms) or townhouses. I think the one floor two bedroom apartments are more spacious than the townhouses because the staircase can cut into the living room. However the townhouses are fine (and bigger than the west campus townhouses) but the windows aren‚Äôt great. These apartments only have a traditional window in the kitchen. The living room ‚Äúwindow‚Äù is actually the sliding glass door to your patio. And the windows in the bedrooms are also actually narrow patios door (with balconies you can‚Äôt stand on cause they don‚Äôt hold any weight) so they don‚Äôt bring in great light or air. And there is no window in the bathroom, just a fan. They feel a lot stuffier to me. 

There is also Storke II which is significantly more expensive (a couple hundred more than Storke I) because they are newer. They are one floor two bedroom apartments and they are the biggest. They also have great windows. The bedrooms are also at opposite ends of a hallway so there is more privacy. 

I‚Äôve lived in family housing since 2019 and I‚Äôve been in basically every kind of unit (from either living there myself or having friends that live in them) so message me if you need any more info! But hope this all helps in making your decision. I don‚Äôt think you can go wrong either way tbh. I really loved living in West Campus but I also enjoy Storke! Like others have said, Storke feels a bit more family centered so it would be nice for your son to potentially make friends in the neighborhood!"
"i'm alumni now, but lived in storke 1 for a couple years before finally getting a transfer to west campus (cost was an issue for us). we did not have children during grad school, but i found the kids at storke roved around like packs of wild dogs. i don't mind kids at all, but it seemed like a general parenting approach to shove them out the door and not provide any supervision at all, which gets annoying. storke also seemed to have more older kids vs west campus. aside from that--we hated storke for the physical aspects. it's literally built on a wetland and has long had serious mold problems. i lived there a couple years and had to throw away most of my leather shoes after about a year cause they were COVERED in mold. housing's solution was to get a fan. sigh. we lived in one of the ground floor apartments (not townhouse). it was like living in a cave. also the grass courtyard never dried out, even though it doesn't rain 8 months of the year. as a result no one ever went out there or played there. we found west campus to be so much better. went into a two-bedroom there (all two-bedrooms are townhouse style in west campus). the buildings are older, but they have so much more light and just generally so much better. and the access to what is now the north campus open space is huge. it's also closer to orfalea childcare (if you go that route) and IV elementary. the vibe was also much better in west campus for us. much chiller environment and still plenty of cutie kids (we always had a few young children living all around us). i graduated and moved out about 8 years ago so take things with a grain of salt, but campus has done nothing significant to change or improve either location, at least as far as i know. any campus housing is absolutely the way to go no matter what because it is so much more affordable. good luck to you and your family!"
"Storke all the way. West campus housing is much older and way smaller, plus further from school is you plan to bike/walk. I don't have children, but if stairs are a concern for your little one, then probably the 1 story 2 bedroom. The storke II has better lighting/windows than the storke I flat."
"I‚Äôm in West Campus right now in a townhouse and have friends with townhouses in Storke. West campus is smaller and quieter, less kids, closer to the trails and the ocean. Storke has more activity, bigger community center and more kids. Regarding floor plans I can only compare townhouses‚Äî the square footage is the same between them BUT in my opinion the storke ones have a horrendously cramped kitchen (like claustrophobic level small). West Campus townhouses by the virtue of not having a wall between the kitchen and the living room is more airy. Oh and a window in the bathroom is nice in West Campus townhouses. Also in Storke aside from more expensive rent you‚Äôre responsible for some of the utilities so for us (two humans, two cats, many plants) we feel very lucky to be in West campus"
Thank you :)
"Black mold?? Yikes. 
Thank you though!"
I will make a small note that as far as I know as a stroke II resident we do not actually have separate utilities even though the website does imply that.

Lower Division F class
What happens if i get an f in a lower division class? Can i retake it and replace the grade or will it still affect my GPA
They take you out behind DLG and shoot you
"If I‚Äôm not mistaken, you can retake up to 16 units of classes where you got a grade of C- or lower on the first try, and only the grade you receive on the second try counts toward your GPA.

For example, if you get a C- or lower in 4 classes that are 4 units each, you can retake those 4 classes (once each) and only the grade on the retake counts toward your GPA. The grade you got the first time you took each class remains on your transcript, but doesn‚Äôt count toward your GPA. After those 16 units, you can still retake a class (C- or lower) but both grades from the first try and retake count toward your GPA (and both remain on your transcript).

I think that‚Äôs how it works. Definitely check with the registrar though."
is that where the beef tenders come from
OP sorry for the troll answer‚Ä¶they actually shoot you behind Girvetz.
Tips for getting the most out of 596/199/99 independent study courses
"There are a few professors I'd like to work closely with, and am thinking about asking them if they'd like to do a 596 with me, either formally enrolled or informally but following 596 standard procedure.

Can folks here who have done a 596 directed reading and research or 99/199 independent study course with a professor (presumably your advisor) help me understand what that entails? ELI5 - how did you approach the professor (proposal/outline), what were the mechanics (meeting frequency, agenda), what were outputs from you (reading reports, updates, writeups, papers) etc. What was the format (is there a format)? How would you characterize your experience? What did you do to make sure you got the most out of it? What else do I need to know?

I'm drawn to do this but also intimidated and don't know how it works. Would super appreciate any information you can share so that I can better wrap my mind around this. Thank you!

About me: Graduated UCSB awhile ago, currently taking postbacc courses, and preparing for a possible masters program entry Fall 2024 and PhD in a couple years. I'm eager to get started with research and want guidance on my literature reviews but am completely green on that front and didn't do a senior thesis during my undergrad."
Temporary Disability
"So i‚Äôve just had ACL surgery on my left knee and am unable to walk at all. I was strongly recommended by my doctor to stay home for at least 1 month(Until February) to attend Physical Therapy and regain the ability to walk. 

I have already emailed my future Professors about my situation, and one of them has already informed me about the Disables Students Program as there is NO remote version of the course. Is this the same for all classes and how will this affect me grades for this quarter?"
"I don't know how exactly it works, or if all professors have to allow this, but in one of my classes this fall a person (I'm assuming they were a DSP worker) sat in the front row of each class and had a webcam facing the board.  Someone was watching the lecture live through the webcam, and they even participated in class a couple times with the help of the worker.  

But yes you definitely need to contact DSP as soon as possible, they are supposed to help you get the accommodations you need."
"take this with a grain of salt. i had a friend who underwent ankle surgery following a bad fall and was on crutches for 2-3 months until her physical therapy; dsp rejected her application because it wasn‚Äôt a good enough of a reason (this was prior to fall quarter so i‚Äôm not sure if there were any updates). she was on crutches all around campus for a month and a half and had attempted to reach out to dsp or any other service about possibly having a golf cart take her around campus temporarily, but it didn‚Äôt work. 

slightly off topic, but i feel your pain with acl surgery TT it took me eight months of pt following my surgery to fully get up and walking & pass my fitness tests (covid times). good luck with your recovery!"
"alright, thank you."
"thank you so much, sorry to hear about your friend."
"i broke my leg when i went to UCSB and lived at FT. DSP paid for my lyfts to and from class, but similarly wouldn‚Äôt provide any transportation across campus. i feel really horrible for anyone that lives on campus and is on crutches! it‚Äôs horrible. i was able to get them to drop my off close to the building but sometimes it was still far. OP definitely talk to DSP ASAP, and if you have a meeting put a summary in writing and email it to them after."
In regards to this I failed to get remote approved for other reasons and they said it‚Äôs extremely hard to get. They said they rarely give it for most physical ailments and will offer some alternative (like this Ubers/lyfts) and they now just started a new program where they‚Äôll take you on a tram to ur classes! Contact them and sign up I got a notification at the end of last quarter to sign up asap because of limited availability

UCSC vs UCSB study abroad
"I'm a student in the UK and my literature and creative writing degree is sending me to California for a year next year. I need to rank my top campuses, and while I have Berkeley at number 1 (for various reasons) I'm hesitating between putting Santa Barbara or Santa Cruz at number 2 since I've never visited either?

Since it's only for a year, I'm not really looking at internships/prospects or anything, mostly which school will allow me to make the most out of my California experience (most options in classes, best social life, most bustling city etc)

Also, I'm queer, trans, and Black, so which school is better in that domain?

I appreciate any recommendations!"
"I'll recommend UCSB. Everyone I met on campus was pretty chill and nice. SB is a beautiful city, and UCSB has it's own beach. For Clifornia experience part, SB is near LA while SC is near SF. Big cities in California. :D"
"Neither is in a bustling city, but SB is much more of a college town and a lot denser than SC. However SC is closer to the next most major city (30 min away)

I have lived in both and would recommend Santa Barbara for an exchange student. It is more social, easier to navigate without a car, easier to find housing at, more organized, and has an airport if you want to visit somewhere else in the US. (SC has its nearest airport in SJC, which goes to more places but is a lot less accessible without a car)

Edit:
UCSC has a slightly better LGBTQ community but UCSB seems ok here as well"
Definitely ucsb trust
"Idk if anyone can answer this question unless they‚Äôve studied at both.

I personally don‚Äôt know anything about UCSC but I‚Äôve seen tiktoks and the campus + surrounding area looks gorgeous. Would probably be a very unique experience. All I can really say is watch YouTube vlogs on the two schools bc you‚Äôre gonna get a biased opinion on either sub."
"UCSC is gorgeous and, I‚Äôd personally say, has a much more diverse student population. However, UCSB is still a really great option and I doubt you‚Äôd run into any issues for your identity. Like some others have said- SB is easier for not having a car and to access the airport. Santa Cruz has a decent bus system though. 

Both cities have fun downtown areas, but I think UCSB has more of a going out vibe, for drinking and going to clubs. UCSC has stuff like forest parties/raves. Both schools have great access to the outdoors, if you‚Äôre into that. Kinda a forest vs beach thing, although both have quick access to the mountains and beaches. At UCSB I‚Äôd recommend excursion club, UCSC the backpacking club is pretty cool and they‚Äôve got lots of other stuff. UCSC also has a lot of activism. 

One of the biggest things I‚Äôd consider if I were you is housing and living cost. Housing is notoriously competitive for both campuses (and Berkeley for that matter), and most UCSB students will be signing leases in the next month for 2024-25. I‚Äôve heard that at UCSC many students have had to defer for a semester bc they couldn‚Äôt find housing. 

Anyway, both schools are really really fun. You‚Äôll have a great time at either. I‚Äôve seen tons of exchange students come through UCSB and never had someone say they didn‚Äôt like it. My partner goes to UCSC so I‚Äôve spent time up there and it‚Äôs also very fun and everyone is really nice. Good luck :)"

UCSB Activity Bingo
Has anyone ever made a bingo card with iconic things to do at UCSB? I am graduating in the spring and would love to see what activities I‚Äôve done/what I‚Äôve been missing out on.
not sure but island view made a checklist of stuff to do before leaving
What is your general cost of living studying at UCSB?
"I'm international and I'm doing some preliminary research on some colleges to apply to. And I would like to know how much you spend in total on monthly fees, material costs, food, housing, etc. per month?"
"UCSB spells it out for you including the non-resident fee on a 9 month calendar.  Books, personal expenses, transportation can vary but tuition, campus fees and housing/ board are set costs. 

https://www.finaid.ucsb.edu/docs/default-source/default-document-library/2324-coa.pdf"
"It totally depends on your habits. This is a broad question,  do you like to party?  Do you like to eat out,  or do you cook?  Are you a smoker?"
"As other people have said, you can find tuition and campus housing costs online, but I haven't seen a breakdown of costs outside of school in this thread, so I'll give you mine.

I live off-campus and I'm an upperclassmen. I eat out a couple times a month, and I go out weekly. I work part-time, around 15-20 hrs/week so my spend is probably higher then someone who doesn't work and needs to stretch their money more.

I  spend around $1200-$1600 a month including rent. Here's a breakdown of a recent month that's a decent portrayal of what my spend looks like.

* $931.89 on rent + utilities (off-campus apartment)
* $204.90 on groceries
* $147.05 on eating out
* $159.81 on shopping (did a lot of furniture buying this quarter, household supplies, clothes) 
* $74.86 on extraneous costs 

That comes out to around $1500ish, so around $500/month outside of rent & utilities. For one-time costs, I spent $70 on textbooks this quarter, and around $250 on clothes. 

You can definitely spend less than I do, and you can for surely spend more. 

Your biggest spend is probably going to be eating out ($12-15 here in IV, and $15-20 if you're eating in downtown sb). Medicine, if you get sick. Groceries, be smart with your purchases, go to places like Smart & Final or Albertson's. If you live off-campus, furnishing your place is going to cost a lot (FB marketplace is a solid bet). Transportation costs can sneak up on you, if you're taking the Amtrak out of SB, or Lyfting/Ubering a lot. Snag an on-campus apartment to save on rent. 

Hopefully that helps!"
general rule of thumb in iv is like $1000ish monthly rent + $500 for food and other misc costs of living
Thank you
"I would like to go to some parties from time to time, but in other respects I am very minimalist and I like to find unexplored ways to save"
"Thank you, this is exactly what I expected, your cost is not bad at all, good job!"
i spent $24 last quarter outside of the fixed school costs
Experiences with academic appeal/ is there a counselor I should go to in specific?
"I‚Äôm going to be meeting with my advisor but I‚Äôm on probation and got below a 2.0 in my quarter (stupid ik). I think i have a reasonable appeal, is there someone I can go to to show my rough draft of an appeal to?"
I was in the same boat last year during the spring quarter. Was on academic probation and got below a 2.0 so I was academically dismissed but I was able to appeal successfully. Definitely set up a meeting with an advisor within your college (not sure if you're in letters of science or engineering) and they'll steer you in the right direction.
"I don't think the appeal should be too difficult, I did it as a CoE student and literally just did a summer quarter and got reinstated lol

Idk about L&S though, regardless, as long as you're explicit with what the circumstances were when you were struggling and how you're going to change them (like, say how, don't just say you're going to do better and not give details), should be all you need."
"An advisor in your college can give you feedback on a draft appeal.

Keep in mind the system is not designed to be punitive (even though it may seem that way). Instead think of it as a fuse you have just blown (and if you were on probation then maybe you just blew that fuse twice). Don't just describe all the challenges you have faced that have caused issues (the fuse blew because I overloaded the circuit!) - remember to also explain why the future will be different (ie the steps you have taken to not overload that circuit in the future). And if the next quarter will still contain the same challenges (ie you still have to work a 20 hour job whilst commuting from LA and being the primary caregiver to a family member) then maybe taking a break until you can prioritize your education may be the best decision in the long term."
So we‚Äôre you subject to academic dismissal or academically dismissed then you filed an appeal?
"This was a really insightful comment thank you so much! I‚Äôm definitely going to talk to a counselor but I‚Äôm kind of in a weird situation where I had some hardship earlier the year, so I don‚Äôt have much coursework completed in general (I got retroactive drops) and subsequently my cumulative gpa is still above a 2.0.  Would these be considered extenuating factors?"
You are telling us this a week before quarter starts?

Hope everything is okay with the professor.
"While I recognize that it is inconvenient for you, the email suggests that this was unforeseeable. For example, it is possible that a medical emergency (e.g., cancer diagnosis, serious injury, etc ) could explain the last minute notice. It's not impossible that the professor quit last minute, too, in which case there's similarly nothing the university can do.

Ultimately, I hope the professor is okay. They would have almost certainly given more advance notice if they could have (and may have hired someone else to teach the course if the change wasn't right before the start of the quarter)."
"It seems like something truly unforeseeable happened. Perhaps a death or sudden firing. I hope the professor is okay if it‚Äôs a medical thing.

As for you, OP, email your advising department right now and ask them what to do. This happened to me once and I was very firm with advising about my need to graduate and they immediately put me in a waitlisted class and secured my spot."
They should see if they can get a different professor or a TA to teach the same class at the same time as the original
"""Wednesday's.""  In an e-mail coming from the English department."
"1. ""that have arise"" and ""Wednesday's"" in a message about an English class is pretty great stuff
2. a nearly 3-hour English class? Oof."
I'm a freshman at UC Davis and I experienced this exact thing my first quarter. Got dropped from my English class and the other sections were full so I had to register for chem cuz I dropped below 12 units. It's rare and it sucks but it happens.

"and ""that have arise"""
And ‚ÄúFriday‚Äôs‚Äù. Pretty bad email overall.
"And ""this inconvenience that it may cause"" doesn't sound right either."
[deleted]
It demonstrates that it prolly was an emergency that caused the class to be canceled. And so they‚Äôre trying to get u the message.
Arisen! Which is kind of amusing coming from the English department of all places.
Wink
"no, what? serious question."
"I'm a professor at another university now (I completed my Ph.D. at UCSB). I can say that UCSB pays better than many other universities. My pay to teach a course as a graduate teaching associate at UCSB was 3 times what my current university pays adjuncts today to teach a similar course. (Of course, the amount my current university pays adjuncts is ridiculously low, as is all too often the case for adjuncts in our society, but hopefully that provides some context.)

It sounds like the university offered a reasonable alternative -- a spot in another section of the course -- and the OP was able to register for the other section. Ultimately, shit happens in life. I don't doubt that the situation is stressful, but part of life is navigating through stressful and unexpected situations. No one did anything wrong here; it's just how life goes sometimes."
Grammar
Should someone tasked with sending out blast emails - at a fucking top tier university - be proficient in basic grammar?
I guess they really need an English class! lmao
Since when has UCSB been considered top tier lol? Mid high? Yes. Top?

"I think rankings are ludicrous for a variety of reasons. However, and FWIW, UCSB was most recently ranked #35 among national universities in USNWR. There are approaching 4000 degree granting institutions of higher ed in the US. Even if you say that USNWR got it wrong by an order of magnitude, and UCSB should be 350 instead of 35, that puts it in the top 8-9% which I'd call top tier by pretty much any measure."
"Yes I have. And I'd submit that ""getting the point across"" is necessary but not sufficient by a fucking country mile.

ETA: and it's \*worse\* than that bc this sort of drivel in ""official"" communication actually ""teaches"" students. At least subtly. You see/read this garbage - and that's what it is - and you internalize it as ""okay"" somehow."
LMAOOOOOO. I guess they should add the definition of a joke to the class schedules too
"What you're saying is misleading. 

USNWR didn't rank UCSB #35 out of every degree granting institution in the US. They ranked them #35 out of the 439 schools they deem ""National Universities""

Shit fair enough
It's certainly top tier but not as exclusive as you make it sound.

"UCSB or NYU Tandon for a PhD in Electrical Engineering? (interested in Microwaves, Photonics, etc...)"
I have been in a dilemma lately. I want to know the best school that would give me the best experience.
You like small cali town or big city. For ~5 years that‚Äôs more important for me
"We have a very good materials science program, so if you're trying to go more into semiconductors and photonics I would recommend UCSB."
"I‚Äôd think for a PhD, your advisors matter more than anything? I think you should spend time in both areas before making your decision.

I live in NYC right now and it‚Äôs the best, but I‚Äôve heard a lot of complaints from NYU students (disjointed campus, seems like everyone‚Äôs just doing their own thing). 

UCSB will give you the classic college experience and SoCal is so nice. It‚Äôs a bit isolated here though and to get to the Bay or LA, you‚Äôll need a car or make friends who have a car. Major downside to SB is the lack of food options imo"
"I'm a be real with you: living in NYC is maybe one of maybe three college experiences I'm the country that might be more interesting/fun than studying at UCSB 

But on the other hand, Santa Barbara is *magical*. 

And SB EE is no joke, every single Engineer I knew in college is making *bank*"
"UCSB has a great EE program and I‚Äôve found in my experience the professors have been personable, and has some reputable professors with connections to companies in the area. 

I‚Äôm currently doing a PhD in RFIC/photonics at UCSB and have had a positive experience so far."
Photonics is a big deal here. We've got extensive cleanroom facilities plus a Nobel winning faculty.
"My sister goes to NYU and I just graduated from UCSB. We‚Äôre from the Bay btw. I loved UCSB and IV. I lived on the beach right next to surf, lived next to all my friends, and lived in pretty nice weather. Everyone seemed happy and there wasn‚Äôt any sense of competition in classes imo. Basically, UCSB was the perfect school for me. My sister had a hard first year at NYU. Way different weather than the Bay, felt lonely, no real campus. Also her dorm was probably the saddest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. Her view was a fucking building lol. But, she joined clubs/sorority and met ppl and now seems to enjoy it. It was an adjustment fs. I visit NY a lot to see her and other friends and it seems like a lot of fun. I work in SF rn, but cld def see myself moving to NYC at some point cuz it‚Äôs so lively and exciting. Ig my point is that ur never gonna be able to live in IV outside of college, but u can always live in NYC without going to NYU"
"do you have a car? if you don't have a car then don't come here, you will be suffering"
Been working at the two places and that‚Äôs a tough choice. If you are an international student Tandon and NYC will bring you more experiences. If you want to stay in the US after PhD the East coast is really amazing. UCSB is also amazing but much more isolated (which I like!)
I like big cities but NY is freezing in the winter season. SB is a small seaside city but got slightly warmer weather in the winter. Which scenario makes you happier? The cost of living in NYC is much higher than Santa Barbara.
Beach vs eyyy i'm walken here
"I don't really know. I mean I like cities yea.

But the thing about NYU Tandon is that it is not a large campus like UCSB.

Furthermore, at Cali you'll be next to many cool places like Pasadena and LA. You'll be exposed to the Bay Area and that. 

I don't really know about NYU if I feel I will fit in because I am not sure if there is that academically rich  environment I am looking for specially in EE."
Yes this is one of the reasons I am very interested in UCSB.
"Both advisors and labs are pretty nice. The NYU lab seems more attractive though. But UCSB itself is got a very strong environment it seems. Like I would get to meet many experts there in different fields and perhaps get internships at different labs maybe at UCSB and get exposed to more rigorous courses.

&#x200B;

But the thing concerning me is living at UCSB itself, many students mentioned the ""boredom"" thing and the ""safety"" issues. I mean if I get to live inside UCSB that would be safe, but living outside campus seems pretty unsafe."
I have never been to the US before so I really don't know which experiencd is cool. I do not know how it feels to be in NYC.
"Yes I am very interested in RFIC/Photonics. This is one of the reasons I am considering UCSB. I have been super confused lately for many reasons. Housing, expenses, safety, etc... But the environment at UCSB seems pretty attractive academically and it seems there are rigorous courses."
Yes that's really why I am so into UCSB. Many people suggest living in NYC tho. So I am in a dilemma here.
"That's a really good point of view. Regarding the dorms thing, do students at UCSB live in UCSB itself or do they live outside campus? Which is safer?"
I mean I can buy one?
"Which is more safer though? Also in terms of expenses, which is harder to live in? I have seen so many people saying SB is super expensive.

Plus for the housing, if I am interested in renting a private room, would that be easy in either places?"
"I mean living in a big city makes me happier tbh, but the thing about UCSB seems to have solid academics and facilities. NYU has a better world ranking overall, but the engineering school there doesn't seem as strong as UCSB.

&#x200B;

Regarding the cost of living, many people say that SB is super expensive. So I am confused on which one is more tough.

&#x200B;

Regarding the housing, I heard that SB itself is unsafe. The question is do I live inside UCSB itself, or do I live outside in the city? Because if I live inside UCSB that seems much safer, but living in the town itself this seems scary."
santa barbara is not near la or the bay at all
"idk that id say you‚Äôre ‚Äônext to‚Äô Pasadena and LA, and if you don‚Äôt have a car your best option of getting to those places is public transportation which is not as reliable as it is in NYC. they are definitely polar opposites in terms of experiences though. the stereotypical college experience portrayed in tv i think more aligns with UCSB than NYU but both are pretty good programs"
"I graduated from UCSB and got my master degree from NYU. You will be a PhD, don't pay too much attention to ""environment"" or ""campus"". Choose the one with better research/academic/job opportunities."
"Compared to NYC, Santa Barbara is boring. Most cities compared to NYC are boring, to be fair. But it‚Äôs not like UCSB is in the middle of nowhere Nebraska. There‚Äôs still plenty of things to do in the area. 

In terms of safety, I don‚Äôt think UCSB or the surrounding area is unsafe. Sometimes you hear about petty theft or (sadly) sexual assault, but this exists on every college campus. I don‚Äôt think NYC is any safer than IV/Goleta/Santa Barbara. During my four years at UCSB, nothing ever happened to me.

I will say, I think the community here at UCSB is tight knit and NYU could be more isolating as a grad student (idk, I‚Äôm just guessing). If you worried are about cost, unfortunately both cities are very expensive, although NYC is a bit more expensive imo. Rent is crazy there.

Sorry‚Äî this seems like a tough decision! I honestly don‚Äôt think you can go wrong with either choice, but it seems like you are leaning towards UCSB. Sometimes your gut choice is the best choice."
"I think UCSB is very fun! If you are into nature & sports as a pass time then Santa Barbara is truly a place you can find mental peace in if you really look for it!! you have the ocean, mountains, waterfalls, so many animal life & a very active community!! You will see people running, biking, walking, working out everywhere you go!! so many parks and the weather tbh is very supbar. There are animal shelters, downtown, clubbing, restaurants, all sorts of local shops and cafes, a very dependable transportation system (busses). Also I think UCSB is a place where you can meet people or make friends quite smoothly if you put yourself out there. If both programs are strong & your only indecisive about fun & environment then UCSB would be a better bet!"
"As a PhD student you should receive at least one year of guaranteed housing in the UCSB grad student apartments (San Clemente), which is a great first location. At one point they guaranteed 2 years, but I'm not sure if they still do.  It's very low cost for the area, right next to campus, and a 5-15 minute walk to any point on campus.  You can take the bus to go shopping in Goleta, walk to Isla Vista, or get rides from housemates or friends if you don't want to get a car right away. 

The neighboring housing areas are in general safe."
"Mix of both. UCSB offers on campus dorms for undergrads and a variety of off campus apartments for both undergrads and grads. The college town of IV is a mix as well. It‚Äôs about one square mile of just college students. There are also some students, both undergrads and grads, that commute from either Goleta or Santa Barbara. In terms of safety, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs generally safe. There‚Äôs emails and alerts here and there about cases and investigations, but not insane amounts. As a guy, I feel super comfortable walking around late at night and always offer to walk my girl friends home. IV is always very alive so there‚Äôs usually other ppl doing shit on the streets"
I think if you can afford to get a car go for it! However many students bike/take the bus/walk in the area of Goleta/Isla Vista. I personally didn‚Äôt have a car at all! I would grocery shop in iv or catch a ride with friends to the plazas! I used to also take the bus which is a 10 min ride to the shopping plazas. The town is very walking and biking friendly which is something many other towns and suburbs lack.
"This is a bit random but check your astrocartography see which city brings you more abundance, balance and happiness. ideally if it‚Äôs close to your Sun, Jupiter, Venus and Mercury line it‚Äôs a good thing,favorable.Avoid Pluto line.Sorry this is sounds like a bit tripping but it is good to know. After all choosing the school location can drastically change your destiny."
I mean we‚Äôre kinda close to la
"The thing is NYU seems to have a better reputation because of the name, but UCSB seems to have a much better program. Both advisors in both universities are nice. I am not sure which has better opportunities. I mean NYC has endless opportunities I believe, but UCSB has a very rigorous environment. There are nobel laureates, clean room facilities, very strong programs. So this is why I am struggling to choose."
"I was on vacation in Japan last summer, and I met this other tourist who did her PhD at ETH Zurich (one of the most prestigious universities in Europe).

I told her I went to UCSB for undergrad and she told me the school is quite famous for its materials program. So, those in academia are aware of the department here and it‚Äôs highly respected.

To the average lay person, yes NYU has a more famous name and is thus more ‚Äúprestigious.‚Äù But honestly in your case I don‚Äôt think it matters at all. If you look at just overall / general rankings, UCSB and NYU are fairly equivalent if I‚Äôm not mistaken. For graduate school I‚Äôd really look at department rankings; the overall ranking is geared more towards undergraduate students."

Goleta beach parking (sandspit)
"I have an 8 am class at the chem building which is close by and I‚Äôm planning on parking there this quarter.
Does anyone have experience parking there for classes? Should I be worried about getting towed? 
Thanks."
.. that‚Äôs what you consider close?
"If you‚Äôre okay with the distance from the pier I would just park in iv, especially that early you might be lucky and park closer to campus but if not you could definitely find a spot somewhere"
"Fuckers gave me a 48$ ticket there last week after parking there all summer 

Just gotta pay or get fined"

PHYS 219 vs PHYS 119B Statistical Mechanics
"Anyone taken any of these two courses recently? I will be an exchange student at UCSB and I initially signed up for 119B as I was a bit intimidated at the prospect of taking a postgrad course (219), but now I am wondering if the difference isn't that massive and I might as well have taken the postgrad course. The course syllabus for 219 isn't too useful because it doesn't specify which topics will be covered in the second half of the course. 

If anyone has any information on these two courses and has any insight on which to chose I would appreciate it.  Also if anyone has taken courses with the professors that teach these courses - Frank Brown (119B) and Matthew Fisher (219) - and has liked/disliked their teaching it would also be useful to know. "
"Fisher is chill while Brown not so much from what I heard. Besides, grading is usually easier in a grad class. But I think that the pace of 219 may be a bit faster than 119."
"Okay, thanks for the insight! I've already covered the first quarter of the 219 course back in my home university so pacing wouldn't be too much of an issue at first anyways.  It sounds like 219 might be the better option then? I'm not too sure if they'll let me change classes so soon to quarter starting but I could try. I was also quite concerned by the fact that if you get less than 80% you fail a postgrad course?"
"I think your concern about grades comes from a common saying that anything below a B is a failing grade in grad school, which is true. But that's why professors rarely give out B and below, unless you really screw up, at least in my experience."
No I literally got an email from the UCSB Exchange office with a bunch of information on course registration and one of the things they said was something like ‚ÄúNote that an 80% or above is needed in order to pass a postgraduate course‚Äù which I found really odd ahahah

crashing math class
"is it easy to crash a math class (4a) when there's 4-5 people before you on the wl? what would you recommend doing in order to get off the wl? (talking to prof, going to all classes, etc?) also, the professor is ponce if that changes things.

&#x200B;

and how does homework from the previous weeks (before you get into the course) work? is it due later or do we get late penalities? (+ on required attendance, etc)

thank you!"
"If you are 4th or 5th on the waitlist for a class with more than 200 people, you are in good standing. Just Show up to lecture and speak with the prof after for further instruction (I.e. if you should go to section).


If there is hwk due week 1/2, ask the prof what they would like you to do.  They will come up with a solution."
Some math classes have a crasher‚Äôs list that you can sign. Make sure to attend the lectures
OP: I‚Äôm currently in math 4a and there is webwork hw! so make sure to attend & ask about it
What does ‚Äúby the bed‚Äù mean for leasing?
I‚Äôm a first year applying for housing in IV. What does ‚Äúby the bed‚Äù mean? Will I not be able to choose my roommates?
"It can also mean this, if I'm not mistaken:

Compare a traditional lease for a 2 bedroom apartment shared by 4 people, all on the lease. Suppose the rent is $2400. Once a month you all get a bill, collectively, for $2400 and the four of you, Annie, Bobbie, Charlie, and Danny have to come up (together) with $2400 to pay the rent.  How you divide that up is between the four of you.

If Charlie goes missing, Annie Bobbie and Danny are still on the hook to come up with $2400 each month, or else find a replacement roommate.  If they don't, they are in default of their lease and could be evicted.

By contrast, in a by the bed lease, Annie, Bobbie, Charlie and Danny would each have separate by the bed leases with the landlord for $600 each.  

If Charlie goes missing, that's between Charlie and the landlord: Alice, Bobbie and Danny still only pay $600. And it's the landlords problem to find a new roommate, not Alice, Bobbie and Danny.

Does that explain it? Does this match folks understanding?

TL;Dr the lease works more like living in a dorm, except it's run privately, not by the university."
"Instead of a group of people agreeing to live together and finding a house to lease, some houses will offer you a spot to live with them. You can meet up with the people beforehand if you want."
"it basically means you rent your bed not your room. Probably little to no control over your roommates, unless you go in as a group."
"OP- this is it. If you see a landlord advertising ""by the bed"" leasing this is what they mean. 

The advantage to by the bed leasing is that if your roommates don't pay their rent, it's not your problem. The disadvantage is that you don't get much control over who your roommates are."
Water bill
How much is your water bill a month in IV?
last year mine was $138.39/mo for 5 bedrooms and 7 people
Depends on how many roommates you have! I live in a 5 bedroom and pay around $200
My apartment got ~$50 last month
I also live in Goleta and we all have 5 singles. It could be different based off your circumstances. ($200/5 roommates= ~$40 each
how many people?

Econ 10a
"I just got off the waitlist for econ 10a but I got a section time I‚Äôm really not happy with. Is section mandatory? And is section switching usually allowed? 

I know a lot of people end up dropping so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll let me switch eventually I‚Äôm just curious if anyone know any info from previous terms"
I didn‚Äôt attend section and managed to get an A. Don‚Äôt worry bout it :) I attended the first couple of sections but realized self studying was better for me
Section wasn‚Äôt mandatory when I took it. I would recommend the CLAS lectures on YouTube to supplement though.
"HOW TO GET AN A IN ECON10A

Hi everyone! As the new school year approaches and more Econ students try to get into the full major, I'm going to dedicate this post to tips on how to succeed in the notorious weeder class. I understand how hard it is to pass -- I've been there, I just finished retaking it for the summer, and I managed to go from an F to an A. So yeah! Feel free to share this post with anyone who might need it.

1. Attend the first CONTENT lecture and figure out whether going will be helpful in understanding the material. Some professors can be really good at teaching, while sometimes it might be better to learn by yourself. Regardless, you want to maximize your time studying for this class (at least 5 hours a week). Don't go to the lectures if it won't help you.
2. There are a total of three tests: Midterm 1 (20%), Midterm 2 (20%), and the Final (45%). All of the content is cumulative, so it is imperative that you understand most of the material you learn. Map out what you're going to do to study for the week up until your next test, rinse and repeat. The time between the last lecture and the actual test is too little to be fully prepared for it. It'll help to plan everything out, I promise. You will thank yourself later.
3. I'm putting the links to the problem set videos from 2020 down below. With these, you won't need to go to the sections every week. Just watch them on repeat until you fully understand how to approach each problem. BTW, Problem Sets 8-10 aren't the most helpful since they use a slightly different method than what the other TAs/tutors use.
4. The most important thing you can do to ensure passing the class is to do ALL of the practice tests. Record every problem you get wrong. Figure out why the answer is the way it is. Really try to understand everything about it. Do those problems again on another day and see if you can get them right. These practice tests are the closest thing you can get to the actual test, so use them as much as you can.
5. Now, if you want to get an A, you should use every other resource there is: CLAS, office hours, the worksheets from the ECON10A Weebly website, the playlist of CLAS videos, extra problem sets, lecture quizzes, modules, and youtube videos (I'll link those below, as well). I usually used these first to get a good sense of the material before doing the practice tests. Also, unless you really, really need to, don't bother wasting your time and money on the textbook.
6. Every point counts! For the midterms, getting one multiple choice question wrong is a 10% decrease in your test grade. You want to leave the testing room confident in your answers. Just knowing the basic material you learn from the slides is not enough to pass. You should also make sure to get full credit on the modules and to try your best on the lecture quizzes. 
7. Be wary of the pacing of the class. You'll notice that the Midterm 1 content is fairly easy to understand, but once you get past that, there will be a lot more things to study and it will get more confusing, especially with post-Midterm 2 material. Save yourself from the stress by making sure you don't fall behind. Use the resources I mentioned above.

Those are pretty much all of the tips I can think of! Thank you so much for reading, and I hope this post serves you well! Good luck!

"ECON 100B, 101, and 140A"
"I just got accepted to the full Econ major and I am currently enrolled in Econ 100B (JOERGENSEN), Econ 101 (BIRCHENALL), and Econ 140A (SWEEN) for Winter quarter. 

**Will this workload be insane?** These are really the only upper div econ classes that I have access to take and I am trying to graduate early so I'm planning on just powering thru. For reference I'm a transfer student and I got an A in Econ10A and Econ5. 

Edit: I finished my GEs and all I need to graduate is my 40 upper div Econ units, so these would be the only 3 classes I take. "
"It will be hard, but not at all impossible. They're each classes that you've kinda got to put in hours to do well. 101 is probably the easiest. If you're up for it, give it a go. If you're down to punt one of them to next quarter, doing two at once will be mellower. If I was going to delay one, I'd punt 140A, as it's kind of a beast unto its own. Are you planning to take anything else, or just those 3 classes?

Good luck!"
101 and 100b is 100% doable but 140 was a lot just on its own
I don‚Äôt recommend it
Do you have other GEs ? If not it‚Äôs totally doable. Many ppl take 3 major courses each quarter. I heard 140 is regression so also depends on your math skills
"It will suck, but it‚Äôs doable.  These classes are the worst UDs in the department, but if you make it through this qtr, it‚Äôs smooth sailing. 

Highly recommend CLAS group/drop-in + CLAS‚Äôs online resources for all three.

Also, for for 101, read the book. For 100B, teach yourself using YouTube (CLAS just posted YT vids too!).   Not sure about 140A as it varies prof to prof, but I‚Äôd see if there‚Äôs any advice on Rate my Prof or on this sub.

Good luck!!"
Very doable.
It‚Äôs‚Ä¶doable - 140A is fairly stats/math heavy and 100B is math/calc heavy. If you have good foundations and skills in those areas then it would be more manageable than if you had to spend a lot of time working through the math while trying to apply the economic theories and concepts. If it‚Äôs only these three classes and you aren‚Äôt super busy with outside things and can dedicate the time needed then you should be fine

Arrived A Day Earlier Before Dorms Reopened
"Hey, I‚Äôm a freshmen at UC Santa Barbara.

For this upcoming quarter I wanted to have an extra day of break before going straight to classes. So I booked a flight to land in SB on Jan 6th at 10 AM. 

To my surprise my dorm (San Rafeal) opens on the 7th at 10 AM.

Is there any way I can get in, even if dorms open on the 7th? Is there a fine I have to pay for entering the dorms earlier?"
"From the parent newsletter: All residence halls will reopen on Sunday, January 7 at 10am. However, to support long distance travel, students can return starting at 12pm on Saturday, January 6 (limited campus services will be available). The dining commons will reopen for dinner on Sunday, January 7."
"There r still people living there. So technically u can wait til someone opens the door and just walk in. Or post here again asking for someone to open the door and hope someone helps. U can also call the # on the door that is for when ur locked out, an RA will pick up and come to the door. Either explain ur situation honestly to them or do ur best at bs‚Äôing and say u forgot ur ekey inside ‚Ä¶.but that‚Äôd be kinda funny if u have luggage‚Äôs lol. The RA has a list of names of either the residents of that hall, or the names of people staying over break. So, they will likely ask for ur access card. Also, doors are locked so once ur in I wouldn‚Äôt recommend exiting."
"if you know any san raf residents that paid to stay over the break, their key tags will be able to open the building doors, you'll need to get in touch w someone maybe try the groupme but without letting the RA know"
Stay in the library?
Sleep on the beach! Peaceful! Waves put you to sleep! I did this nearly once or twice a week while I was there.
Commenting to bump this to the top.
"That wouldn't matter, the ekey to get into their specifc suite wouldn't work rn. They would need someone from their suite that was staying over break to let them into their room."
library is closed
Bruh how were you able to sleep through the millions of beach bugs that covered the entire beach past midnight and the 40 degrees wind chills? I could never lmao
Library opens tomorrow at 8:00AM
Ha it‚Äôs really not that bad. Also definitely California bubble. 40 degree wind chill is not even remotely cold.
"There's no library late nights during break though, closes at 9PM so you cant stay overnight"
English10
"Hello, does anyone have experience with ENG10? I need something to clear my A2 requirement in the future, but I wanted some information from people who have taken ENG10 before since I hate writing in general, especially essays of any sort. I was wondering how difficult it is in general for someone who doesn't enjoy reading or writing. Rate the difficulty of the course from 1-10. Also, I heard that for Pass 1, only majors are allowed to add the class, so I was also wondering if the class is popular among non-majors who just want to clear their A2. Thank you. And for those who would skip this class and take one of the writing courses that also fulfill A2, which one did you like?"
for context i‚Äôm a bio major who took this class for my A2. i took it over the summer and it was an easy A. had some friends take it last quarter tho and it seemed like the curriculum was completely different and it sounded way more complex
"also, doesnt anyone know if A2 is able to be taken outside of UCSB, for example I know that Econ 10A has to be taken at UCSB"
"From what I can tell, it really depends on the professor. I took it last summer and it was a hard but interesting and rewarding class. But like another person mentioned, I've talked to others and they said it was pretty easy. I think generally the prof gets to focus on whatever they want subject-matter-wise which can really impact the difficulty of the class and how interested you are in it.

For me, the essays weren't anything too too out of the ordinary, but if you struggle with reading and writing then the course might get rough, as it is gonna be a lot of reading. I would say it was about a 7/10 for me in terms of difficulty but I did enjoy the class (also as someone who isn't hugely into reading and writing). If you decide to take it, just make sure you seek out resources to review your writing and hopefully you should be okay!"
You can take your A2 requirement at a community college. Just remember to check if it‚Äôs transferable.
eemb 127 recorded?
does anyone know if eemb 127 ( plant biology and biodiversity ) is recorded by any chance there‚Äôs this other really cool lab that conflicts with it once a week and i wanted to see if i could get away with taking both classes üòô
MCDB 1LL bio lab 1
Does this class have a final exam? Trying to book flight tickets for spring break and the date is unknown on gold.
we just had a final project you work on throughout the quarter when i took it
no it was just a final research project u turn in online
Bioma Expedition
"Hello! 

I am going on the Bioma Sea Turtle Expedition this summer to Costa Rica and I was wondering if anyone can give any advice and/or their personal experiences with the program? Im a bit anxious about traveling to Costa Rica on my own as I've never been and have rarely been outside the US in general but I am very excited for this opportunity!! "
"Most of the host families don‚Äôt speak any English, so if you know Spanish that‚Äôs very very good, and if not, I would try to learn at least a bit before going. Most of the students get paired and have another student ‚Äúroommate‚Äù in the host family, which makes it a lot less intimidating. If you speak Spanish, even if you‚Äôre not completely fluent, try try try to speak and connect to your host family! They‚Äôre amazing people. Don‚Äôt bring a roller suitcase if you can avoid it."
Looking for two roommates share 2b2b at Cortona Point Apartment
"Hi, I am currently a third year student at UCSB. I am looking for two female roommates to share 2b2b together beginning from January 2024. Hope are willing to keep quiet at night and keep the apartment tidy and clean."
what‚Äôs the rent?
4 years of photography
"Wanted to share some pictures I have taken over the years, I don‚Äôt know how to take pictures lmao but let me know what y‚Äôall think ."
Dang picture 13 by far showcased your skills accumulated over the years in photography! I love the thought and effort you put into hand designing your unique focal point of the image!
The dewy cobweb one #15 is my favorite. Creative choice of subject and cool lighting!
"I like that the last one has a lot of movement in it! Have you taken any of the Art department photo classes? Even just taking one lower-division photography class made a huge difference for me, was totally worth it as a person interested in making pictures."
Very cool shots
"One of these pics is not like the others!

But I'd say 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, and 17 are sort of samey, know what I mean?  But my closest exposure to photography is dating a photographer, so don't take my opinion seriously."
picture 5 is insane !

How do I get financial aid for a 5th year
"I‚Äôm already receiving financial aid from FASFA and Pell Grants. I‚Äôm staying an extra year and wanted to know how to apply for financial aid for a 5th year? I also saw that FASFA covers ~5-6 years of schooling too, who do I contact??"
Cal grant usually only covers for 4 years and is the bulk of most financial aid. In the case of an extra year ucsb will usually cover a bulk of that money through your ucsb scholarship. I‚Äôd contact the fin aid office though they are pretty helpful navigating all of that.
In the same boat. Will update after phone call
"just apply, im on my 5th year, literally just applyüò≠and youll get it lol"
please inform us!
Yes pls!! Thank u!!!
Barc mistake?
"This year I filed a financial appeal and got it accepted during fall quarter. So that being said, some of my reimbursements were retroactive from fall aid increases. However, on barc, each fall reimbursement check was then added to my owed balance (for example, balance of for winter fees1000$, get a reimbursement for 100$ for fall aid increase, new balance $1100 owed). Is this a mistake? Has this happened to anyone else?"
i‚Äôm in the process of a financial aid appeal rn and i wanted to know how long yours took? i first applied in november and they‚Äôve requested diff documents from me 5 diff times and they said they‚Äôre still looking at it
So I started my appeal on the day they opened for this school year. It didnt get approved until November. They requested the same exact tax doc 3 times and the fourth time clarified they actually meant a different document. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
I really regret not transferring to UCSB For Econ/Accounting; I had my reasons
"I transferred to UC Davis in 2017 and majored in managerial economics and minored in statistics. When I was deciding on colleges as a transfer student I could have transferred to UCSB for econ/accounting. It mostly came down to UCI, UCSB, and UC Davis as my transfer schools. I didn't like to vibe of UCI when I visited. I loved UCSB, and mainly just wanted to go for the environment. It was a beautiful small campus, weather is amazing, and it is right next to the beach. I liked UC Davis as well, but UCSB seemed much more appealing. However, what drove me away from UCSB is a few things.

1. Being Isolated, I thought there wouldn't many internship opportunities and campus recruiting because of the area. Though I knew there was a fair share of recruiting, and I know the big 4 recruits UCSB econ/acctg students
2. I wasn't a fan of accounting, I did not like that
3. Main reason, econ10A mainly drove me away from attending. I really did not want to take that risk of not passing Econ 10A and having to do something else.

But UCD sucked and some are reasons you wouldn't expect them:

As expected for the most part, I found that there were limited parties. Most of the parties were very small. Only the frats, athletes had those big parties. The nightlife also sucked. A few small bars and two nightclubs. The bartenders and bouncers are very strict and overprotective killing the vibe of the night. I felt like to really get that college experience you really need to live in the dorms or join greek life. Though, You usually had to know people or have connections to get into parties. There were quite a few. I am also an evening MBA student at Santa Clara University, and the social scene is absolutely terrible there. Though, I don't know if that is because of it being a grad program, and a part time program. But in terms of social scene at SCU, it feels a lot like UCD.

Quite a bit of people were pretty shitty, but some were also down to earth. This is the same with the professors and graduate student TAs (some professors, and Tas were terrible). It was hard to see through many of the people though because they put on a ""fake smile"" at first, and over time I had realized how shitty some people were. I've had people use me and once they got that something out of me they just completely ignored me, that had been very common with people there. A lot people were nice, but it was hard to make genuine friends from those connections. I only managed to make a handful of closer friends, all being guys. Idk, If I would have had this same experience at UCSB. As an evening MBA student at Santa Clara University, I am also a working professional, and a lot less connected to student life as I was at UCD. But people there aren't shitty at all, in fact 99% of the people I met aren't. However, it is even harder making genuine connections that program as it was at UCD. Most people in the program are busy with other things, it's a part time MBA program. People in the Santa Clara University MBA are also superficial, but not malicious. Though People in the Santa Clara University program both display the same type of rudeness, but I feel like SCU evening mba students do more of that (ie being on their phones in class, coming late, talking while the teachers talking, ie), the professors at SCU also tend to display this behavior.

I wasn't able to land any internships or post grad jobs through the career resources at UCD. The only thing I was able to really land is a few part time jobs, and an RA position with the UCD department of economics. The same could be said with SCU as well. I feel like a lot of campus recruiting is bs. Going to those career events can help you learn, but it will not help you land a job. I feel like universities and college kind of pry on that whole corporate bs. I feel like college as a whole is kind of a scam. I was successful out of college, but it was only based on my abilities.

UCD has a nice campus, and i feel like the location there is underrated. It has a rep of being in the middle of no where, which is somewhat true. Major hubs are an hour away. Sacramento is close by. This is a college town and it has a nice vibe. I liked living here, and honestly because of that these two years were really fun for me. Housing is great, cheap housing! Also, lower cost of living, which is great! Cons: Town is small, lack of jobs. It's hard to find employment here due to the town being small

But with that being said, here is why I felt like I should've chose UCSB. I got at least a ""B"" in all my economics class at UC Davis. I even got that ""B"" in intermediate microeconomics(same course as econ 10a) at UC Davis. This was a very tough class though, and I got a 68% in the class but it was curved to a B, because I was in the top 40% in the class. I failed the final, and if I retook the final, I still don't know if I would have passed though. With that being said, based on how I did at UC Davis, I felt like I could have passed Econ 10A at UCSB.

After graduation at UCD, I have been mainly working in accounting (private accounting for the most part). I think I will ultimately pursue something in accounting after all, though accounting was not my first career choice as a career path. I wanted to initially pursue something else. But little did I know, there not a lot of business careers outside of sales, accounting, and customer service. Besides, me being good with numbers makes accounting an optimal profession. But in 2017, I really did not know much about careers. It was until I started working, I found this out. Also, by being in Econ/acct I could have been cpa exam eligible. 

In conclusion, I am just feeling regret. Idk if I would have had a much better college experience at UCSB. Not only that, but maybe could I have longer lasting friends who I kept in touch with after graduation, better connections, would  I also feel like I would have probably had a better professional career. I feel like I could have landed a role at a big 4 company. I feel like they only hire students who go to the accounting route, regardless of how good their application is, but idk, this is just speculation. The SCU MBA does not seem very good either though. I feel like I won't have long lasting connections there either, and the program would not help me land a job much more then I am at right now. 

Please share your overall thoughts, and please comment on your experiences with UCSB personally. I'm curios to know if people are shitty at UCSB? How the professors, Tas, and people. "
"I think your thinking is a bit skewed towards negativity. Could you have had a better experience at UCSB? Sure, but plenty of people here struggle with the same things you're describing. It's hard for a lot of people to find their place in social circles, and even harder to make long term connections that last beyond college. 

It sounds like a lot of your regrets stem from thinking that other people are necessarily having a better experience. As an econ/accounting graduate myself, big 4 is simply overhyped and not for everyone. 

I really encourage you to try to take a different perspective on your situation. You graduated and are working in accounting which sounds like what you want to build your career towards. You should be proud of yourself because that's not easy. 

What is easy though is looking back at our past decisions and feeling like we should have done something differently, but the only reason we can think that now is because we gained knowledge and experience since those past decisions were made."
"I wish I had gone to Davis but unfortunately was not accepted off the waitlist. Partying with random people that don‚Äôt care about you and being far from home got old quick, at least it did for me. It really affected my mental health and in turn my performance in school. I did end up graduating but I think I‚Äôd have been better off going to a different school."
Congrats or I‚Äôm so sorry tldr
Stop blaming yourself for the things you cannot change
"If you were a B student at Davis, you probably would have been a C average at UCSB. Davis doesn‚Äôt have many distractions, and so that encourages you to focus on your goals and study. I‚Äôve known of friends-of-friends who failed out of UCSB because they partied too much.

UCSB would have probably have been a fun school for you, but besides house parties and drinking on the beach, there‚Äôs not much in Isle Vista or Goletta to do. At least with Davis, housing is much more affordable; I can afford to have my own apartment and live alone, whereas if I was in UCSB I‚Äôd have to share a room cause a damn studio goes $3-4k/month off campus. Trailers are being rented out for $2,700 a month. 

If the lack of partying is all that you regret, why didn‚Äôt you apply to UCLA or UCSB for grad school? You can always drive down to Chico, for a day, and go party. 

I‚Äôm assuming that you graduated from Davis in 2019, and now it‚Äôs 2024, so why *now* are you making a post about how you regret Davis?"
"Shit man, I‚Äôm a ucsb student and I regret not going to Davis sometimes. Grass is always greener man."
repost
"there's pros and cons for every uc campus. when presented with multiple choices it almost makes it more difficult in that there's always that ""what if"" in the back of your mind. paradox of choice? i had a similar choice between ucsb vs uci vs ucsd vs uiuc; tbh i'm not sure if i'd choose ucsb again if i could go back in time.

if you went to ucsb you probably would've disliked things about the school too. regardless, you've been out of undergrad for some time now and a bachelor's from uc davis is well-regarded. the economy is tough atm but you can pivot into other roles if you grind hard enough. lots of people switch careers.

to answer your last question, there are a lot of personable, intelligent, and hardworking students at ucsb. like any good uc, you had to have done well in high school to have been admitted here. i've also met my fair share of douches and people that i wondered how they even got in lmao. there's people of all different kinds at every school.

in terms of academic quality-- i was a stats major and people here complain about the dept a lot, but i actually had a great experience with my professors and ta's. the rigor and curriculum prepared me well for an actuarial career, but i was disappointed with impacted classes, expensive and shitty housing, and lack of diverse food in iv. no school is perfect."
"You are right. I know I have to do it, but it is just so hard. It is over, and I have to move on. After graduating, I did not look back, but recently I started attending the evening MBA program at SCU and have recently started looking back."
"Yes, I agree about partying. It's not that fun, unless you know people or if strangers are nice! But in most cases it is overhyped. I was very academically focused, and knew when I had to stop."
">ve been a C average at UCSB. Davis doesn‚Äôt have many distractions, and so that encourages you to focus on your goals and study. I‚Äôve known of friends-of-friends who failed out of UCSB because they partied too much.

See I have laser focus. I knew when to not get distracted and when to stop. That's one of my strengths I would say. I didn't get into UCLA. I didn't have a car when I went to UC Davis, and none of my friends were down to go to chico. though looking back, I definitely could have made a few solo trips"
"but some genuine comments: I do believe its good to expect less out of people, especially strangers you've just meet. It doesn't matter if they're at SCU, UCD, or UCSB; the probability of running into asshole doesn't approach zero just because the school is different or you age more. In fact the inverse is true, and I tend to find people engaging in more un adult like activities (ie not partying and just genuinely doing a hobby for fun) more tolerable and happy.

Work on yourself. If you want to go big 4, check out r/accounting; its never too late to break into the path if you plan to get a CPA, and dealing with more people in a work setting might help you get better at finding those you'd actually enjoy spending time with. Nothing happens without a reason: the point is to make the most out of it."
"As an econ student I don't have to tell you about opportunity cost... there's always going to be something you're foregoing to pursue something else, so it's easy to get swept up in what-ifs. I know it's cliche to just say ""be positive"", but I truly believe that the way we talk to ourselves in our head cultivates our feelings about things in the long term. Keep reminding yourself how far you've come because like I said, it's undoubtedly something to be proud of."
"Hmm ü§î 

You can claim you have laser-focus, but it‚Äôs unlikely that you would have been as focused at UCSB as you were at Davis."
UCSB CCS Application Questions: Letter of Intent
"This.

I am a HS senior wanting to apply to UCSB CCS. I am basically chasing the Jan 4 priority deadline and treating this like any other essay. Then I realized that not only do I have to directly address the faculty, there is 0 examples of this exact task to be searched up on the internet. So, How do I write it? How do I format it? And where do I get examples of it?"
"Best advice is to clearly and honestly answer the specific prompts for your major - prompts are found here:

https://ccs.ucsb.edu/apply

Scroll down to find the prompt for the major you are applying for. There is no specific length or format requirement but keep in mind faculty will be looking at hundreds of applications so there is no need to pad it out. I see plenty of good letters that are a couple of sides.

This is NOT like your college application essays, it is much more specific."
"As a CCS student my recommendation is just to tell your story. Who are you? What led you to discover you enjoy whatever major you are applying to? Why do you love it? What experience do you have in the field? Make sure to answer the letter of intent prompt listed in the application while doing this.

Don‚Äôt overthink it, you‚Äôve got this."
"Each major has its own prompt, and you should look up the one for yours and respond to it.

But in general, my advice is to be sure that your letter describes three things that are essential for any CCS student:  passion, preparation and products.

Passion: Successful CCS students typically have a deep interest, curiosity and ambition about their chosen field of study. What interests you about your field of study? What can you cite as evidence of that passion?

Preparation: Successful CCS students have often done a lot of study of their chosen field already, either through formal education (classes in school), informal education (self-study, clubs, camps, etc.) or a combination. What have you already done that prepares you for this program of study?

Products: This varies from program to program but successful CCS students have often already produced some artifacts that demonstrate their ability to take on something ambitious of their own choosing and see it through to completion. Is there anything like that you can describe?

Hope that helps."
"Just wanted to mention that for both the math and physics CCS application the deadlines have been extended. In case you were applying for either major, you can still withdraw edit your application even if you submitted it already."
CCS application- password reset issue
"Hello, I'm currently applying for a composition major in CCS and forgot the password to my CCS account, so went to reset it. An email was sent with a link, but clicking on it only brought me back to the page asking me to input my email. Thus, currently unable to reset password and locked out of my account. What should I do?"
"Contact the CCS student advisors. Probably Heidi Dinnogen is your best bet:

https://ccs.ucsb.edu/people/staff/dinnogen

We have moved to a new system this year (sigh...) so let her know clearly what your problem is (maybe w/some screenshots) and that will help them troubleshoot the system and prevent the same mistake happening again."
Econ 10A Grade Distributions
"Did any of the professors for Econ 10A ever mention what letter grade distributions are on average based on previous years? Like what percent gets As, Bs, Cs, and so forth. 

I need a B or better to get into the major since I already took Econ 1 and Econ 2 at a community college during high school."
"Hello,

I hope you are doing well. Previous grade trends for ECON 10A can be found in the Daily Nexus Grades Search which is found [here](https://dailynexus.com/interactives/grades/courses). This goes all the way up until Summer 2023. I hope this helps. Have a great rest of your Winter Break and good luck in ECON 10A!"
"To follow up, please make sure to take advantage of the resources offered at UCSB for 10A. This includes (but is not limited to) CLAS, Past Exams, and more. If you have any further questions, comments, and/or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out. Have a great night!"
Awesome! Thanks for all the resources and advice!

Any language for which UCSB offers a course, they offer. The SRB is right by the pardall tunnel across from the parking lot, and the people at the front desk are more than happy to answer any and all questions.

Personally I‚Äôve done the Russian tutoring, and the girl was so nice and helpful."
Thank you!
Timeline for grad school application
I applied for a PhD in anthropology (IAS). I want to know if there's a timeline for decisions to be made? Are there interviews before final decisions? And what is the best time to hear from grad school?
"I'm pretty sure it varies by department. I had my interview around mid-December and was notified of my acceptance a few months later. But I'm not in the Anthropology department. If I were you, I'd reach out to the grad coordinator and ask? It can't hurt."
"I'll do that
Thank you."
Did you end up emailing/hearing back about a timeline/ if they do interviews?
"Yes
There are no official interviews except for the one you have with your potential PI prior to application.
Decisions come out around mid January"
Ah cool! Thanks so much!!
Econ 136A
Anyone know who teaching the Monday 4-6:50 slot? I hope it‚Äôs fulkerson because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the econ website
"Hello,

I hope you are doing well. From what I have heard, it might be a new professor from the ECON Department who is in that slot. However, I do not have any further information on who is exactly teaching it. Some professors in ECON courses have been switched around for Winter and Spring Quarters (i.e. ECON 100B & ECON 138A). Hopefully I'll be able to find out who is teaching it and update you on the matter. I hope this information helps!"
"It‚Äôs not fulkerson, he said it might be someone new. He‚Äôs from LA apparently"
Rip to the dream
"Smh. Fulkerson asked me if I‚Äôd see him again in a couple of quarters after my 3B final, I guess it‚Äôll have to be another class üò¢"
Professor has just been posted. It is James Kim for the upcoming quarter. Best of luck in ECON 136A!
Do you know who they are? Have they ever taught before?
OChem Textbook
Whats the name of the textbook used by prof Lewis? 
Organic Chemistry 8th Edition by Paula Yurkanis Bruice
"Prospective student applying for CCS. The ""priority"" deadline is January 4th. Does anyone know if they still take applications after this date?"
title
"Yes, they will definitely still accept it.
Whether it will be considered any differently to an application that came in before the deadline depends on how the particular major processes applications and when you submit it. 
If it's only a few days, or even a couple of weeks late, my guess is that most majors will not treat it any differently but I can only guarantee this for Biology...

I'm now recalling a similar question last year where I gave a slightly longer answer:

https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/10cjhwr/priority_vs_nonpriority_for_ccs_applicants/"
"It depends on the major, you should email one of the professors who runs the ccs program of the major you are interested in to find out. I think the system will let you submit the application regardless, but that doesn't mean anyone will look at it or consider it."
I didn‚Äôt submit my app until April (CCS Bio) and still got in for the following fall so I think it‚Äôs always possible! I believe it‚Äôs a rolling-type application but definitely still email your prospective department for more details.
"If it's in by the deadline, it's guaranteed to be considered.

If it's just one day late, it's *probably* still going to be considered.

But we faculty are given our own internal deadlines (by the college and the university) for reviewing these, which we don't typically disclose publicly (because then everyone would treat those as ""the real deadline"").  

The more days late you are, the more you risk that the faculty just won't get around to reading your application.

So try your best to get it in as soon as you can."
Just curious if CCS students can do research with non CCS faculty?  How deep should LOI go into specific research interests?
"Yes, surely. In fact, if you are a chemistry major, about a half of your cohort may do research with a faculty of other departments (MCDB, EEMB, Materials, Chem E, etc.).

You should mention your specific interest. It can be a sub field or sub sub field of your major. Be sure to talk about how you prepared yourself in this niche, tiny but truly yours."

suppose you have an opportunity to go to Europe for a week to visit a boy you‚Äôre deeply in love with (so obviously can‚Äôt pass it up) but you have to miss classes for a week. Do you disclose your trip to your professors or tell them you‚Äôre sick week of? This is coming from someone who gets really anxious missing classes
"Congrats

Check syllabi but probably sick week of"
Week of sickness 100%
"Depends a ton on which week it is.  Ideally you're there for the first week just to get oriented and obviously missing any week that's going to have quizzes or midterms is not a good idea.

If you've got any friends in your classes, you can ask to see their notes."
As long as u don‚Äôt have a test you‚Äôre probably fine
girl get that boy.. check.
lol don‚Äôt people skip class anymore? I knew people who skipped virtually everything but the midterm and final. If they don‚Äôt take attendance it‚Äôs not a problem
Covid still works as an excuse. Maybe include some element of self awareness about using the excuse to REALLY sell it. HVe fun!
Covid is going crazy rn so you can use that excuse
"Tell them you‚Äôre sick. 

Also, the vast majority of people don‚Äôt get to do this‚Ä¶so enjoy it if you can."
you are all my kings & queens. thank u for the advice & happy new years!

"that‚Äôs the zete cat, i live across the street and i think they feed him because hes always there"
"That's Floki, I've talked to his owners (an old couple that live near Cordoba). Been roaming for a few years now. I think about a half dozen people feed him including his owners."
"Yea that‚Äôs him, he lives in my apt building actually he just wanders outside from time to time. The couple do in fact take care of him :)"
Grocery Shopping in IV
I haven't really cooked before and I am planning to start soon. I just wanted to know if there are any good/cheap groceries in IV.
Save yourself a buck or two and go to Albertsons or smart and final. Grocery stores in iv have a shitty variety and are ridiculously overpriced
Bike to costco and smart and finals. There is absolutely no good/cheap groceries in IV
No you should hit grocery outlet in SB
"I‚Äôm pretty sure the iv coop is the only grocery store in IV. It‚Äôs not too expensive compared to your regular supermarket, has a good collection of essentials for your cooking needs, and you really can‚Äôt beat the convenience if you don‚Äôt have a car. The next closest would be Albertsons, Costco, and smart & final in/near the Camino real marketplace in Goleta. There‚Äôs also a sprouts and a Trader Joe‚Äôs on the other side of Goleta, which is a slightly longer commute."
"Bus goes from UCSB to Marketplace. There you have target, Costco, Albertsons all within walking distance"
go to the food bank on campus
"Costco is the best. For fresh produce, Albertsons.

Forget IV."
if you can manage a bus or bike ride i really recommend santa cruz market for basics and produce - they take ebt and are much more affordable than sprouts even
"Like everyone says, going into Goleta via bus for groceries is your best bet. But if you're in a pinch, IV Market's prices aren't the worst. I tend to prefer going there just because it's slightly easier to go there as a disabled person than Albertsons (big ass parking lot to cross, no crosswalk to get to the bus-stop across the street). The IV Market has some decent deals on meat sometimes and it has some specialty items I struggle to get elsewhere (like sriracha mayo).

The Co-op across the street from the IV Market has insane prices, but it's fresher and better quality food. The sourdough they sell rocks though. They've got all the organic and vegan and etc food that's like healthier for you and better ecologically and ethically, but yeah, they really hit you on that price tag.

IV Deli, which is down like a block or two from these two places, has some more ""in-a-pinch"" food if you need food asap and don't have the time to get to a store in Goleta. It's pretty expensive, too. They've also got some food that's hard to find elsewhere, and the Deli also makes its own food that is pretty good. Not cheap though.

Another block or two in that direction is a 7/11. Which isn't a real grocery store, but they sell a lot of stuff. If you need cat food, cereal, toilet paper, or a quick preprepared sandwich or something, 7/11 is 7/11 with 7/11 prices."
Sorry but the coop is still quite overpriced
"I think IV Market is pretty decent! The staff in there is great and they have a decent selection of everything you may need: bread, milk, cheese, eggs, ground beef, pasta, etc!"
"Co-op is generally overpriced, but they have some good deals for seasonal, local produce sometimes!  I follow their instagram page and check in to see once in a while."
"Yeah but the convenience might be worth it, especially if you don‚Äôt have a car or you have ebt"
It really depends on what you buy there
Really? Other than house brand pasta everything else I can think of is significantly more expensive than at other super markets.
Is my Aid going to change next year?
"Hello, I am a first year and have some questions about next year's aid, how likely is my aid going to change next year? What are your experiences with the financial aid given to your second year compared to your first? Do the scholarships I have now, like the need-based ones, stay for my second year as well? For context, my parent's income has not really changed from last year. "
"You have to file the FAFSA each year so if there are some income changes from previous year, then your financial aid can change also. Since the FAFSA form is new and has made changes for the 2024-2025 year, I would assume there are will be changes to your financial aid.  Hard to determine until you complete the form and compare your EFC for this year to the EFC (now SAI) for next year."
"from my experience, after going from on campus to off campus housing, i did receive less aid i.e. I did not get a UCSB scholarship for this year. However, I did get more from my middle class scholarship compared to last year. don‚Äôt fret too much if your parents‚Äô incomes haven‚Äôt changed that much as that‚Äôs a big reason for your aid changing a lot."
"Yes, but only yours"
Senior Housing
"hello! i'm a junior transfer student and am stressing over housing for next year. i currently live in sierra madre, and i'd like to apply for the off campus apts again but i know it's not guaranteed that i'll get a contract. i found a place in iv for a good price, but they want me to sign next week and apartment apps don't open until the 29th. 

i heard about tropicana villas, and that you can use financial aid money to pay rent which sounds nice, but i'm unsure when their applications for next year open

any advice is greatly appreciated, sorry this was so long! :)"
"maybe take the place in iv since it‚Äôs guaranteed. you can use your financial aid towards any rent (off campus apt, unaffiliated iv apts) since they refund you the extra money fin aid money that doesn‚Äôt go towards tuition."
Quarterly Barc Check
please lmk if and when you got your refund! tryna figure out if they‚Äôve dropped yet :3
Holiday weekend man. Checks probably gonna hit after the 1st so after rent is due for most people üò≠
Mine says that it was dispersed on the 30th so probably will hit the account tomorrow (:
i got mine
Check your umail.
barc refund
"hi, i havent seen any refund on my barc balance for winter quarter even though i always get aid. any ideas?"
its been glitched
Usually goes out the last Tuesday of break
"Log onto MyBARC and look at the transaction details. If your aid for winter 2024 isn‚Äôt there, log onto your MyAid account and see if there are any actions you need to take. If there is a credit balance in MyBarc, it should refund. If you are signed up for direct deposit, it will hit your bank account in 3 to 5 business days. If you‚Äôre not sign up for direct deposit, you will receive an email to your umail.UCSB.edu address. Reply to that email, and they will process once they reopen on January 3rd,2024"
Mine was released on BARC today if you look in ‚Äúrecent transactions‚Äù you can see it. However it is a holiday weekend so it might not come to my bank account until like next week‚Ä¶
tysm i was so scared ab paying tuition and rent üíÄ have they made any statements yet about it?
not that i know of but theres a lot of reddit posts about it and im in a groupme for a scholarship and theyre all talking about it tooüò≠
is a C- in bio psych 106 passing???
pls tell me asap üò≠üò≠
C- is passing as long as you don‚Äôt need a C in it for a prereq for any other classes required for your major
if it‚Äôs required for ur major don‚Äôt you need to get above a c-?
"If it‚Äôs not a class required for your major, take it pass/fail."
"If you‚Äôre already in the major, as long as you have an above 2.0 in upper divs you should be good to graduate"
"Yes, it‚Äôs passing, you‚Äôre fine."
"Technically yes, but if it‚Äôs a pre-req for grad schools (unlikely) most require a C."
this is if you need to take the next course in the series i believe
r u sure
cuz for me i have to get above a c- for prereqs and stuff
yeah isn‚Äôt a c- not passing? check ur major sheet
Missing Owala Tumbler by Stairs

New Year Buddy
Hi I‚Äôm an international student studying here over the break and most my friends are gone. Anyone wants to do something safe and local together to celebrate the new year?
Yeah sure but I‚Äôm flying in during afternoon
EEMB 2/ MCDB 1B recorded?
MCDB 1A had all their lectures recorded and that was really helpful to rewatch and study. Are lectures recorded and posted for MCDB 1B or EEMB 2 as well? 
"yes, on gauchocast. at least it was last year."
"I can confirm that the plan is to record EEMB2. I think they do a good job in Campbell Hall and they usually frame it just so that there's a dark section at the bottom for the stage/front row of seats that is perfect if you use the captions.
Source: am teaching EEMB 2 next quarter (Evolution section)."
both classes?
that's perfect thank you !
FEMST 30 with Anisha Thomas
"Has anyone ever taken this class before? If so, would you say it was an easy GE? (for context, FEMST 30 is called women, development, and globalization)."
"I took this class with Thomas last spring, and ultimately it did end up being pretty easy, but it was very vaguely structured - the syllabus didn‚Äôt give much information on how our grade would be determined in the class. I didn‚Äôt love the professor‚Äôs lecture style, kinda all over the place"
"Were there any exams or quizzes? And what was the midterm/final, if applicable? I‚Äôm deciding whether to take it or not since I‚Äôm taking three other courses (two of which are my major courses)."
"When I took it there weren‚Äôt exams, just assignments and a final group project. I‚Äôd suggest going to the first lecture and dropping it if it‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre looking for."
"Got it‚Äîand so sorry, last question: was there a lot of required reading and stuff that students have to do on a daily basis?"
"Haven't registered for classes yet, how fucked am I?"
"Well, as the title states, I didn't register for classes, I was dumb enough to put it off for a month to focus on midterms. How fucked am I? I am a third-year majoring in psychology, still need some gen eds that aren't available. What are my options to do?

Edit: seems like I have to have 12 units to waitlist courses, I‚Äôm also a transfer student this is my first year here"
"It takes maybe 10 minutes to pick courses - at least your major specific ones.

This will be a very expensive fuck up, I would recommend creating a spreadsheet so you know exactly what courses you‚Äôll be taking come spring."
good luck lol. try to get 12 random units just for full time status then plan to take summer classes. also talk to an advisor asap
"Omg are you serious? How dumb can you be? I once accidentally missed my pass time by a week and it was a grievous error. I literally couldn‚Äôt get into any of the classes I needed, no matter what I did. I ended up taking the quarter off. If I were you, I would honestly do the same. Look at it this way: is it worth paying $15K to take classes that aren‚Äôt even useful to you? And in the future, SIGN UP FOR CLASSES ON TIME. It takes two seconds."
Are you majoring in procrastination?
"Talk to advisor, if you have fin aid, you‚Äôre basically fucked but you can still try n fix it. Get ANY random classes, can even overlap, IF you‚Äôre planning on changing them on week 1."
just take the quarter off and register for cc classes for ur ges you‚Äôll be ok
"It's not game over by any stretch, though your quarter may be less ideal than you'd hoped. You can add these courses to your schedule right now in GOLD: 

RG ST   132B - JEWISH DREAM INTERP

CMPSC 5A ¬†-¬†INTRO DATA SCI 1

ENGL 176BC¬†-¬†PERFORMANCE OF LIT

They all have open seats ATM and no pre-reqs. 

*Then* start WLing/linking courses you actually do need (UD PSY, PSY 10A/B, etc). You may also want to [enroll in this cross-campus course](https://search.uconline.edu/view/107986?title=PSYCH+133G+Psychology+133G%3A+Culture+and+Human+Development&home_campus_id=8) (which is included in your UCSB tuition and, if necessary, could be used to get you to 12 units and considered full time for FA purposes, provided you're enrolled in at least 8 UCSB units and are in regular academic status).

Don't listen to the brow-beaters in this thread. Instead, ""work the problem..."" I've seen this scenario a lot; it's def recoverable if you hustle.  

-Dave"
"This is a tough one but in the grander scheme of things you can recover from this. See if you can fill up your schedule with any classes that will give you needed credits, get on some waitlists, and talk to your advisor. I‚Äôm not sure about psych, but most majors have some room to take classes that aren‚Äôt required for GEs or your major, so worst case you could just take some classes that interest you. Everyone fucks up sometimes, give yourself a break and start looking towards solutions. Wishing you the best!"
"How the fuck did you get to your 3rd year without realizing classes is what you go to school for!! 

Failing your damn midterms is cakes and biscuits compared to not having classes at all!

It takes a 20 minutes conversation with your department advisor to pick out a nice schedule especially if you‚Äôre targeting GEs like you said. I got fucked over one quarter for missing my pass time by 30 minutes, 1 month? You‚Äôre fucked hard."
"See if there‚Äôs any major classes that you need that have smaller waitlists. Try emailing the professor and ask what their crashing policy is. Do the same for ge classes that will give you credits that you need, especially those with shorter waitlists. 

For the most promising ones, sign up on gold for as many as you can. Crash these and hopefully you can get into at least three. I saw someone else say this but it‚Äôs probably a good idea to make a spreadsheet."
Reverse imposter syndrome moment
How are you this irresponsible smh
Dawg
"Next time set a reminder on your phone when registration hits. Even if you were studying for midterms, you have to have some free time in some form to register for those classes."
Bro you fucked up way back when you decided on psychology
It takes ten minutes to sign up for classes though? Why would you put off something that doesn‚Äôt even take long for a whole month
psych major üò≠
"Good luck, you might need to do UC online (or I forget what it‚Äôs called where you can take classes at other UCs online) to be able to get your financial aid"
You fucked up but you‚Äôre not fucked. You‚Äôll be aight lol
"Just try to get into any classes that get you 12 units and then get on waitlists. Hopefully you‚Äôll get into at least one or two of the classes you waitlisted for. If not though, during my last 2 quarters before graduating I already took all the required classes I needed but still needed to fulfill my unit requirement, meaning I could take any classes I wanted. So if anything the random classes you can get will fulfill your unit requirement if it doesn‚Äôt fulfill anything else."
So many ppl drop from classes the first week you‚Äôll most likely get into the classes ur waitlisted for. Just show up to those first classes!!! Also talk to an advisor over the phone they can put u into classes that might be closed on ur end you‚Äôll be fine!
"Email professors and beg for add codes, works fairly well usually"
"Missing your enrollment date is kind of the opposite of ‚Äúfocusing on your studies.‚Äù 

My university allows students to skip a semester and enroll the following semester without penalty or special process."
"I'm going for my associates in marketing at my local community college - I just registered for classes the Thursday before Christmas. I didn't realize how early course registration starts, literally halfway through whatever current semester, the registration begins for the semester coming up üò≥"
Email the professors that you‚Äôre waitlisted in and explain your situation
"Go to a class you‚Äôre waitlisted for , email and bother TF out of the professors"
[removed]
drop out transfer to cc come back in two years
"I have nightmares about this, weekly"
Naw your probably fine
"YOU are gingerbread to be ok. Go to the Trioss office if they have one. Go to an advisor. Lots of people drop a class the first week. Don't stress. Everything is fixable. Worst case scenario, you messed up and see if you can hop a plane and study abroad. Kinda joking, but seek help and advocate for yourself."
"Look you've fucked up but from my experience its recoverable. Sign up and waitlist for as many classes as you can. Prioritize major classes since you'll eventually have to do them. The waitlists are also shorter for those and that the prof ( for my major at least ) are more likely to handout add codes. For GEs, go to as many section with different TAs as you can cause they also give add codes ( don't have to actually  attend the lecture for GEs).  

TLDR
1. waitlist a bunch of classes even if the time clashes
2. go to lectures for major classes and ask prof for add code
3. crash GE sections for add code
4. pray"
Everybody needs to chilllllllll like damn yall comin after this guy. He‚Äôs human. things happen and stress affects everybody differently. Shit happens and guaranteed it won‚Äôt happen again.
Bro what üíÄ
"Yea ur basically gonna be part time this semester. I highly doubt you will even get to fill ur schedule with any class let alone the ones you want. Regardless, you should check check in with your advisor. During my time at UCSB they were very helpful."
Ya. You're done
"See if there are any late start classes that you can take. WARNING-these are condensed classes so keep on top of the work. Good Luck!
ps: I am proud of you for taking college classes!"
"You may still have a chance to register for some of those gen ed courses. What you may consider doing is joining the waitlist. It is typical for the number of seats taken in a section to decrease when the tuition payment deadline approaches. Check back on the tuition payment deadline, and you may be able to register at the last moment. This is not guaranteed to happen, but it it is possible."
I was dropped from my classes due to an error with my financial aid my last quarter at school. I just literally attended all my classes with the hope of being added with an add code at the last second. I was able to add all the classes I needed. But I didn‚Äôt add some till the 5th week and final day possible. That might be an option for you.
"I think you‚Äôll be fine, not everyone stays in the classes they enroll in. If you‚Äôre third or higher on the waitlist there‚Äôs a high chance you‚Äôll get in."
"I assume this was an anxiety related thing. Because I‚Äôve definitely done this before for that reason üòÇ. It won‚Äôt be the end of the world, take this as a learning opportunity.

You likely can still get a full time course load that will work for your graduation goals. But probably not with the professors or classes you initially wanted. Also, there‚Äôs a lot of moving around in the first week. You might get in to a waitlisted course or two."
"It‚Äôs really easy to take a Leave of Absence from UCSB, I just clicked a few buttons on GOLD. There‚Äôs not much of a point in paying for random classes that don‚Äôt count towards your degree. Everything happens for a reason maybe this is a sign from the universe to take a break."
"If you are able to register for some of the classes you need, then do so. Otherwise, just take the time off. It's not the end of the world if it takes you slightly more time to graduate."
"tbh I think you should just take the semester off... thats what I am doing, sometimes we need a break to do better in the future and think things through. All the best to you and goodluck."
lol
I got every class I wanted 10 days ago. I can‚Äôt imagine it being that much worse?
Yeah idk what he was thinking with this one
"Lmao yall really gotta chill. Actin as if the person committed murder, it‚Äôs not that serious but I love yall took the attempt to take your suppressed emotions out on someone asking for help/advice. It‚Äôll be aight. 

Had several friends in the same point, still graduated on time. Couple psych, another physics.  And another English.  Don‚Äôt listen to these fools OP, you were focusing on your midterms. It‚Äôll buff out, shit happens. 

Listen to actual advice, and not people virtue signaling. üòÇ"
This üëÜ
This is beyond that
The problem with that plan is that most Community Colleges run on semesters. Any courses will most likely run into the next quarter as well.
Thanks for helping this student!
Such encouraging words from a guy named pussydestroyerr420
Relax
Those don‚Äôt count towards the full time status. You need 12 units at your home campus to enroll in UC Online as well.
"Good call.

Do an advanced search in GOLD and look for anything w/ open sections (e.g. CMPSC 5A, Econ 9, etc.) We're still in pass 3, so students can still make changes before LSAA reopens Jan 3. 

Hopefully student is in Jr. standing, which will open up add'l options for them. 

As you point out, no WLing (and linking, to maximize your chances) until you're in 12 units. And when you WL/link, don't just check the box for one section, but for as many as you can that won't cause add'l schedule conflicts. I've met w/ a lot of students who get shut out of a chem or phys lab, say; when I look at their GOLD I see they only checked one time slot. 

[As I mentioned earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSantaBarbara/comments/18u1559/comment/kfkjo9h/), OP is in a tight spot, and odds are this quarter will be suboptimal. But it's still salvageable."

Exactly what's with the top comments
"not foothill and deanza, you can take all classes remotely for most ges, I forgot to register for classes one quarter and took them while living in iv"
"Not true.

If you're in 8 UCSB units and find a 4-unit class through [UC Online](https://search.uconline.edu/) (formerly known as cross-campus enrollment), you will be considered full-time for financial aid purposes. You won't be able to see the cross-campus course on your GOLD, but the registrar will be able to see that you're in 12 units. 

Note: if you are on academic probation, you cannot register for a UC Online course; it's only for students in regular academic status.

This student is definitely jammed up, but I've seen victory snatched from the jaws of defeat before. Best bet: contact [L&S Academic Advising](https://duels.ucsb.edu/advising) through q-less when they open at 9:30 AM PDT on Wed, Jan 3.

Most classes are completely full there too. Was looking to find an extra class just a week ago. Everything is totally full. I checked through maybe 30 different classes across various disciplines.

barc error?
"Hi! 

So today I looked at my BARC amount and I have a *way* higher refund coming my way than I thought. I received another scholarship but it shouldn't have been that much of a change.

Is anyone else in this same position? Did they run it twice?"
"Yeah for some reason mine is 22k refunded where it should (usually) be around 5700, it must be wrong :/"
Mine said -14k and after reloading it went back to 0.00 on everything. Theyre just dangling a carrot on a stick
"Dude, look at it again tomorrow morning."
Yes mine says 19k
Also having the same problem
Why does it say 0??? I usually get about 5k back
"This happens literally every year and almost every quarter, it‚Äôll go back to normal funding soon it‚Äôs just a system error or whatever haha"
"Okay yeah, that's like mine too lol. Although it's probs an error, I am praying we have just won the Yang lottery"
How do you get 5k back
"It probably got paid out to you, check the refund tab on your barc account and the most recent line will also say 0 for now but that means the money was paid out to your bank account. You can look at transaction detail too and see everything itemized"
It looks like they accounted for the estimated aid twice though unfortunately

Looking for a roommate!
"Hi! My name is Justin and I'm currently a 3rd year at UCSB and I'm just looking for a roommate to live in a 1 bedroom double for the 2024-2025 school year. I am also currently a member with Embarcadero company so I would have priority for their 1 bedroom doubles :))

All I'm looking for in my roommate is someone who is capable of not leaving any messes, you don't even have to be super clean, just aware of when a mess is being made. We also would discuss things like sleep schedules, guests, and noise levels with each other separately! Also, and most importantly, I would really prefer that you are a student as well, just to live with someone around my age range!

Rent would be: $800-900

Deposit would equal around one month's rent.

Utilities provided: Water, trash, parking

The utilities that need to be paid for (electricity, gas, internet) also typically cost me $30-40 a month.

[https://www.embarcaderorentals.com/rentals.html](https://www.embarcaderorentals.com/rentals.html)

The buildings we would be applying for are 6596 El Greco and 6509 Madrid, no specific unit yet. Both of these units are very close to campus. Laundry rooms are on site for both buildings. There will be one parking spot in El Greco that I would have to use if that is the building we get. If we get 6509 Madrid, there are two spots, a guest spot and our designated spot.

We would also be applying for other units from different rental companies together just as a backup and I have some planned out already!

Please DM me on Instagram with the handle j.\_chong for any more information or so we can schedule some sort of conversation to get to know each other! Thanks :))"

I do have a group of three people including me, and still couldn't find anyway to apply as a group; most of the application process seem to be done by individuals so that the apt later group them randomly."
There are triples in Sierra Madre. There is a self selection process where you may be able to if beds are not already taken. If you do end up in Sierra Madre you‚Äôll either be in a 5 person apartment or a 7. Good luck!
Thanks :))
Is your school like the movies
"I‚Äôm from Uk and always wondered what USA uni or schools are like
Are you allowed phones in class 
Do you all hangout in your groups like nerds stick together and jocks stay together 
Are there lots of party‚Äôs 
What are frats and kappa etc 
Do girls wear high heels etc or the mean ones who think there better than everyone else 
Also have any films or tv shows filmed at your uni 
Thanks for Reading
"
there‚Äôs a gnome studies department that‚Äôs it
"This isn't highschool lol lots of people mingle with different social groups. Party scene varies between schools but UCSB is known to be one of the bigger party schools. The Greek life domination also varies between schools, at public schools like UCSB there tends to be a fewer percentage of students in Greek life (compared to private schools). People wear whatever the style is, some wear pjs even and many just wear pants and a shirt. I can't remember the last time I saw someone in heels to be honest lol"
yes and we have food fights and wedgies
Think of any college then add a beach
There‚Äôs a group of exchange students that smoke next to the library that‚Äôs as movie core as it gets
"You can use your phone in a giant lecture hall easily, but if you have a small seminar class then it‚Äôs generally frowned upon to be on your phone or even disallowed. There are some sports teams or that who all become friends, but you‚Äôll never really be able to look at a group of people and know why they became friends. There are a lot of parties at ucsb and I‚Äôve seen foreign exchange students really shocked by them. Frats and sororities are social clubs sort of and some of the members live in large houses together and wear matching outfits. You have to be accepted into these and pay to be in them. I‚Äôve never really seen heels around here except for at graduation or going out. People do not wear heels to class. Here‚Äôs a list of things seemingly filmed on campus at ucsb: https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?locations=university%20of%20california,%20santa%20barbara,%20california,%20usa I‚Äôve never seen any of them"
Pretty sure this is a bot
Watch 'Revenge of the Nerds'  for an accurate depiction of school life.
Pretty much yea
this is my favorite post on the planet
Yes
"Haha.  Id say it used to be exactly what you saw in movies,   Unfortunately covid and politics changed ALOT at ucsb. I‚Äôd say Isla Vista in 2016 and 2017 were its best days. I wasn‚Äôt here for anything before that."
What's that
"Dk what greek life is 
Wait people are allowed to wear pajama 
And do you get bullies or fights"
Do u actually
Oh wow u have a beach near u school
How so
Oh wow why do u have to pay and do the school allow alcohol
I'm not
Including the sexual assault yeah
Lucky
Why
So cool
Classic UCSB alumni statement: ‚Äúmy years here were the best days.‚Äù
Oh wow so can u share anything
it's like the movies
Yea the bullies are pretty bad. You‚Äôre so fucked
no hate do you know where this school even is
Unfortunately
Lol u joke
What happened
Never seen movies with that
Oh what do they do
"Yeah Santa Barbra 
I used to watch a tv show that was filmed or set in Santa barbra"
It‚Äôs like a hour or so from Hollywood
I wish bud
Do police or teacher not do stuff
Not much. If you do come here just make sure to be careful and look out for your female friends. Greek life is pretty gross here.
Oh are u a girl and can I ask what is Greek life I don't understand frat kappa all that etc
"Fraternities / sororities. Some of them are fine I'm sure, but a lot are super gross and predatory, target teenage freshman, drinks get spiked, that kinda thing. IV in general is a fun place to party just make sure you're always taking care of yourself and of your friends."
"But what are frats sororities other than they have party‚Äôs what are they or why do people have them
Oh I‚Äôm surprised teachers allow party and alcohol on school"
Will I be dropped from my classes if my BARC payment is done but not processed?
"I am an international student and was going to be back at my hometown at December 21st. I pay my fees through Flywire international payment and I wanted to deal with it myself with the bank at my hometown, so I contacted the BARC office and asked them if I could make the payment a week after the deadline. They told me that I won‚Äôt be dropped before the new year, so I thought it will be totally fine and payed all the fees at December 25th. But turns out Flywire requires up to 3 business days to process my payment and after that the university requires up to 3 business days to process it too. Flywire finished processing it at December 28th and the university still shows that my fees are not payed. Will I be automatically dropped from my classes just because it takes them so long to process already finished payment ?"
"No, you won‚Äôt be dropped. There is a few week grace period where you might have a ‚Äúblock‚Äù if in unpaid status but they don‚Äôt drop until later after the barc office gets caught up."
Student success comp grant
A week ago I checked my student account and saw that this grant has been applied for this 2023 fall semester but I still haven't received it. When do these typically disburse?
Have you emailed BARC to see why?
self guided tour over winter break
Hi there! I‚Äôm a senior college applicant visiting Cali for the first time for a week to do some college tours (USC and Pomona) and self guided at UCSB and UCLA (since there aren‚Äôt any tours available). I‚Äôm wondering if there will be anything happening on campus Jan 2nd / 4th. Is it still worth checking out? Or would it be a waste of time since less people are there? In my eyes checking out Santa Barbara might still be worth it even if the campus is closed.
"People will start getting back into town, but there won‚Äôt really be anybody on campus. You can check out the beach, the campus and koi ponds, maybe the campus store (not sure if it‚Äôs open), and eat at a local food place or two. Head downtown agterwards or find a place to rent kayaks or something"
"Hi! UCSB is amazing! I hope you have a fantastic visit! The campus itself (architectural wise) is pretty average, however the college town and oceanfront location is what really makes UCSB so incredible (I was a USC transfer to UCSB so I know both schools well). On your visit to UCSB, definitely spend time in Isla Vista. Have lunch there (maybe Sam‚Äôs to Go if you‚Äôre in the mood for sandwiches), and then walk through Isla Vista towards Del Playa street, where there is beach access. While in Santa Barbara itself, State Street is the Main Street where there are tons of shops and restaurants. Great place to spend some time. Have the best trip!"
What's your prospective major? If I know any students in town in your prospective department I can ping them to see if anyone's willing to chat.
"be sure to drink lagoon water, it‚Äôs got magical properties! fr tho go campus point at sunset"
Thanks so much! I‚Äôll check these spots out!
Thank you so so much! I‚Äôll definitely check out these spots!
Why did you leave USC?
Hi! I‚Äôm super indecisive so I put social studies undecided and humanities undecided (very helpful I know)!
"USC was great in a lot of ways‚Äî great academics and professors, fun sports culture, etc. I joined a sorority, sort of out of necessity for housing and met some nice girls. I visited a friend at UCSB and just knew it was a better fit for me. It was a super laid back and collaborative environment and really friendly. Loved living in a college town, and having a 1 minute walk to the beach. I was nervous to make the transition because I had friends at USC and was happy-enough‚Ä¶.but once I transferred I never looked back and knew it was the right decision for me."
"A hidden gem major at UCSB (for all of us humanities indecisive folks lol) is Global Studies‚Äî smaller major but so many good professors and classes in the department. If you end up at UCSB, it‚Äôs worth exploring for sure!"
">em major at UCSB (for all of us humanities indecisive folks lol) is Global Studies‚Äî smaller major but so many good professors and classes in the department. If you end up at UCSB, it‚Äôs worth explorin

Will check it out, sounds like something I'd be interested in! Thanks!"
parties nye
y‚Äôall is anyone throwing any parties here in sb? i know most peeps have gone home for the holidays but just shooting my shot üëÄ
Yea 9th floor of the library slide
Republican Club
"I‚Äôm genuinely curious to ask this, no hate to the Republican Party club at UCSB, I myself am an independent and get along with anyone who‚Äôs Democrat or Republican, but what are their meetings about? I‚Äôve seen their instagram where they announce meetings weekly. Like I just die to know what their meetings are about? What do they discuss? Also, does UCSB have a Democratic Party Club? I‚Äôve never heard or seen any flyers about one."
Obviously they talk about making America great again
Jelqing
Don‚Äôt know much but I do know a democratic club. Insta is ucsbcampusdems if you wanna look into it
"The format is essentially open ended discussion on preset topics. Usually various events from the week or month, and then having an open discussion or a ‚Äúsplit room debate‚Äù it‚Äôs really jolly good fun even to folks who don‚Äôt peg themselves as traditional republicans. They usually take a fairly big tent strategy so there‚Äôs some trumpets, neoconservatives, libertarians, paleo libertarians, paleo conservatives and the odd ancap, or neoprag or dark enlightenment enjoyer. I frequented a lot of political clubs for a time and found them to be the most welcoming and fun to the more ideologically curious. The YDSA is straight up hostile to outsiders (openly insulted my then GF in front of-me for ME having differing opinions to them(she even brought them some food and they had the Gaul to be mean about it)). Campus democrats exist but it‚Äôs really boring and main-line. It is less of a political club and more along the lines of career guidance since most young people, and college students especially already have most of that grab bag of beliefs and thus there isn‚Äôt much to talk about in that respect."
"Hi, I make said posts! We discuss current events, things that are happening around IV and campus, and popular political topics. Some of the posts list the discussion topics in the caption. It‚Äôs pretty casual and chill. Anyone of any political affiliation and background is welcome, you don‚Äôt even have to be into politics to come lol. We also have events like bbqs and beach days. And yeah there is a Campus Democrats club and they have an instagram account as well. Lmk if you have any questions :D"
Suspect comment
Gaul
"I also can‚Äôt forget GPD, it used to be in a pretty dire state but now they get pretty decent attendance, they are more similar to the format of CR. They are a bit less energetic and cover more abstract topics, since they can‚Äôt focus on one side of politics with relatively common beliefs between the members."
Lmfaoo god that‚Äôs lame. ‚ÄúJolly good fun ü§ì‚Äù
im sure your club is very hostile to actual dialogue.
"In all honest curiosity, do you discuss how broken the party is considering how the leader for the nomination is an insurrectionist and ineligible to serve?"
Join the cause brother
"Haters will make fun of you for being jolly üò§üò§üò§ Me asf:

I am not a member of any of the aforementioned clubs

"We discussed the election a bit last quarter and I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll return to it again in 2024. To be fair, Trump has not been found guilty at this point and is therefore still eligible to serve as of now. The current two party system is far from perfect but that‚Äôs why we get together to talk about things."
I don't think anyone asked
"$20, he‚Äôs ineligible. He won‚Äôt be."
14th Amendment doesn‚Äôt require criminal conviction. Alexander Hamilton Stephens the Confederate VP was denied office even after being elected as Senator. Couldn‚Äôt hold office until the amnesty.
He was literally impeached twice lmao. Which is even more impressively stupid when you realize it‚Äôs half of all the impeachments of presidents in USA history. He‚Äôs definitely been found guilty of plenty.
I did.
[deleted]
"It doesn't require conviction, but I think it's a bit too subjective, the language needs to be more objective. What constitutes ""insurrection"", or ""rebellion""?

""...shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.""

Half the country wouldn't stick those labels on him, have to have more than *feels* to justify his removal. The case made against him has to be abundantly clear, I'm convinced he's guilty, but many more need to believe that too."
He‚Äôs gonna get the nomination without a doubt
you should come to the club and talk about it with us! tuesdays @ 7pm ucen state street room ;)
"It‚Äôs self-executing, so yes it will."
[deleted]
If it weren‚Äôt then why was Alexander Hamilton Stephens denied a Senate seat until 7 years later when the amnesty went through?
[deleted]
"No it‚Äôs not. Insurrection, and aiding and abetting insurrection, no matter when done, renders you ineligible for office, civil or military."
